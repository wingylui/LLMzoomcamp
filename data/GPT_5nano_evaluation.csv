Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 65 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 225 ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tins
- 300 g plain flour
- 100 g cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- Pinch of salt
- 400 g light brown soft sugar
- 300 ml milk
- 2 tsp white wine vinegar
- 100 ml strong coffee or espresso, cooled
- 2 tsp vanilla extract or paste
- 3 medium eggs
- 400 g butter, at room temperature
- 800 g icing sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract or paste (for buttercream)
- 4–5 tbsp milk (for buttercream)
- Food colouring pastes (pastel pink, purple and yellow or colours of your choice)
- Edible flowers, pastel sugared almonds or mini chocolate eggs, to decorate

Step-by-step instructions

1. Prep the oven and tins
- Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.
- Oil three 20 cm cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment.

2. Make the dry mix
- Weigh the plain flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and light brown sugar into a large bowl.
- Add a pinch of salt and whisk gently to combine. Shake the bowl to bring any lumps of sugar to the surface and squeeze them with your fingertips.

3. Make the wet mix
- Measure the 225 ml vegetable oil, 300 ml milk, 2 tsp white wine vinegar, 100 ml cooled coffee and 2 tsp vanilla into a jug.
- Add the 3 eggs and whisk to combine thoroughly.

4. Combine and bake
- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir with a whisk until smooth and free of flour pockets — the batter will be quite runny.
- Divide the batter evenly between the three prepared tins.
- Bake on the middle shelf of the oven (or middle and top if they don’t all fit on one shelf) for 25 minutes. Swap the tins around and bake a further 5 minutes.
- Check the cakes are cooked by inserting a skewer into the centre — if wet batter clings to the skewer, return the tins to the oven for another 5 minutes and check again.

5. Cool and (optional) make-ahead storage for sponges
- Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 30 minutes, then turn the sponges out onto wire racks to cool completely.
- If making ahead, wrap the cooled sponges well and store in an airtight container for up to three days, or freeze for up to two months. (The assembled cake will keep in a tin at room temperature for up to five days.)

6. Make the buttercream
- In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat 400 g room-temperature butter with an electric whisk for a few minutes until smooth and creamy.
- Add half of the 800 g icing sugar and beat to combine. Add the remaining icing sugar, 2 tsp vanilla extract and 4 tbsp milk and beat again until you have a smooth, fluffy buttercream. Add a splash more milk if needed to reach spreading/ piping consistency.

7. Colour the buttercream
- Divide the buttercream between three bowls.
- Add a few drops of different food-colouring pastes to each bowl (pastel pink, purple and yellow were used in the original) and mix well until evenly coloured.
- Spoon each coloured buttercream into a separate piping bag and snip off the tips.

8. Assemble and decorate
- Pipe a small dot of buttercream onto your cake board or stand to anchor the first sponge, then place one sponge on top.
- Hold a piping bag directly above the surface of the sponge about ½ cm from it and pipe small blobs of purple buttercream all over the top by squeezing and pulling upwards to create little peaks.
- Place the second sponge on top and repeat the piping process with the pink buttercream.
- Add the third sponge on top and pipe blobs of yellow buttercream across the surface.
- Finish by decorating with edible flowers, sugared almonds or mini chocolate eggs for an Easter showstopper.

Storage / serving note
- The sponges can be prepared ahead (see step 5). The assembled cake will keep in a tin at room temperature for up to five days. Wrapping and allowing components to rest for a day will let the flavours meld — this cake is well suited to being made a day or two ahead.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a complete recipe for a chocolate & vanilla celebration cake, including Easter-appropriate decoration ideas and make-ahead/storage guidance, directly addressing the user's request."

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 40 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 60g self-raising flour
- 3 tbsp cocoa powder
- 3 eggs
- 75g golden caster sugar, plus extra for scattering
- 200ml double cream
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- 50g icing sugar, sifted, plus extra to serve

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan)/gas 7. Line a 22 x 32 cm swiss roll tin (a 20 x 30 cm tin is also fine) with baking parchment.
2. Sift the self-raising flour and cocoa powder together into a bowl and set aside.
3. Crack the eggs into another bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) and add the golden caster sugar. Use an electric whisk or the whisk attachment to beat the eggs and sugar together for about 5 minutes until pale and very thick.
4. Gently fold the flour and cocoa mixture into the egg and sugar mixture with a spoon or spatula until completely incorporated and evenly coloured, with no streaks.
5. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and spread it out to the corners. Bake for 9–10 minutes until the sponge is puffed up and springy to the touch.
6. While the sponge is baking, prepare another piece of parchment slightly larger than the tin and scatter it with some extra caster sugar.

8. Score a line 2 cm from one of the shorter edges, then use the parchment to roll the sponge into a spiral with the parchment running through it. Leave the rolled sponge to cool completely.
9. While the sponge is cooling, make the filling: whisk the double cream, vanilla extract and sifted icing sugar together until the cream stiffens.
10. Unroll the cooled sponge and spread the filling evenly over it, leaving the scored 2 cm edge clear.

Total cooking time: 210 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 300g soft butter
- 300g caster sugar
- 6 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 80g plain flour
- 300g self-raising flour
- 100g plain full-fat Greek yogurt
- 3 tbsp milk
- 8 tbsp seedless raspberry jam
- 150g soft butter (for butter icing)

- 600g ready-to-roll white icing
- 200g ready-to-roll pink icing
- 250g royal icing (made from a pack of royal icing sugar)

- 20 pieces chewing gum
- 40 sugar cubes
- Silver balls (dragees)
- Green food colouring
- Mini sugar blossoms
- Edible glitter
- Coloured cake board
- Wooden skewer
- Coloured sandwich flags or candles

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat the oven to 160°C / 140°C fan / gas 3.
   - Grease and base-line a round 13cm cake tin and a round 18cm cake tin.
   - Place two muffin cases in a muffin tin (these will make the turret/tower).

2. Make the cake batter
   - Put 300g soft butter and 300g caster sugar into a large bowl and beat together until light and creamy.
   - Add the 6 eggs, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, 80g plain flour, 300g self-raising flour, 100g Greek yogurt and 3 tbsp milk. Beat well until combined.

3. Bake
   - Half-fill the muffin cases with batter. Fill the two cake tins about 3/4 full.
   - Bake the cakes with the cake tins on one shelf and the muffin tin on another.
   - Baking times (approx): muffins ~35 minutes, 13cm cake ~1 hr 10 mins, 18cm cake ~1½ hrs. Check by inserting a skewer into the centre — it should come out clean.
   - When muffins and the smaller cake are done, open the oven door and remove those quickly so you don’t let too much heat out while the larger cake finishes.
   - Allow all cakes to cool completely before icing.

4. Assemble sponge layers and tower
   - Trim the tops of the two cakes so they are flat. Slice each cake in half horizontally, spread with the seedless raspberry jam and sandwich back together.
   - Using a 6cm cutter, cut each filled muffin to make a cylinder. Trim the tops flat. Sandwich muffin pieces together with jam to make a tower/turret.

5. Make butter icing and crumb-coat
   - For the butter icing: put 150g soft butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually beat in 300g sieved icing sugar until smooth.
   - Spread the butter icing over both cakes and over the muffin tower to give a crumb-coat.

6. Cover with ready-to-roll icing and stack
   - Roll out the 600g white ready-to-roll icing and use it to cover the two cakes. Place the larger cake on a cake board and put the smaller cake on top of it.
   - Roll a strip of white icing and wrap around the muffin tower. Place the tower on top of the smaller cake.
   - Push a wooden skewer through the centre of the cakes and tower to hold them together securely.

7. Make dome and attach turret top
   - Using about 150g pink icing, mould an onion-shaped dome and set aside.
   - Roll out a little pink icing and cut out a 6cm circle; place on top of the muffin tower.
   - Using the prepared royal icing, attach the pink dome to the top of the tower.

8. Add doors, windows and details
   - Use the pink icing to make two doors and two curtains; attach to the cake with royal icing.
   - Make windows from the lilac (or light blue) icing: cut out hearts in medium, small and tiny sizes and attach them upside down to the cake with royal icing.
   - Roll a thin sausage of lilac icing and stick it around the curtains to make window frames.
   - Score horizontal lines down the doors for texture and attach silver balls as door handles.

9. Decorate with chewing gum, sugar cubes and flowers
   - Using royal icing, stick pieces of chewing gum around the doors and sugar cubes around the edge of the cakes.
   - Attach a piece of gum under each middle-tier window, then stick three mini sugar blossoms on top to make window boxes.
   - Attach silver balls to the dome and doors as additional decoration.

10. Pipe foliage and finishing touches
   - Colour the remaining royal icing green and spoon into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle.
   - Pipe creeper branches up the castle walls and attach mini sugar flowers.
   - Stick coloured flags or candles into the middle tier of the cake.
   - Sprinkle a little edible glitter over the dome and sugar cubes for sparkle.

Tips (from the recipe and helpful for beginners):
- Ensure cakes are completely cold before icing to prevent melting and slipping of fondant.
- Chill the cakes briefly after trimming and filling to firm up crumbs — this makes icing neater.
- Use a long wooden skewer through all tiers to stabilize the stacked cakes.
- When removing smaller cakes/muffins before the large cake finishes baking, open the oven only briefly to avoid losing too much heat.
- Royal icing acts as an excellent glue for candies (chewing gum, sugar cubes) and small decorations.
- Work on a clean, level cake board and use a little buttercream to anchor the base cake to the board.

4b1f6b22-2a75-4fcd-b1e4-f78442d9697e,Easy recipe for Curly Twirlies using ready-to-roll croissant pastry filled with toffee and dark chocolate (about 40 minutes)?,"Recipe name: Curly Twirlies

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 40 minutes

Calories (kcal): not provided

Ingredients:
- 140 g soft toffee
- 100 ml milk
- 2 tubes (each tube contains 6) ready-to-roll croissant pastry (eg. Jus-Rol)
- 50 g dark chocolate drops (or a block of dark chocolate, roughly chopped)
- Golden icing sugar, for dusting

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / gas mark 6. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.

2. Make the toffee sauce: put the 140 g soft toffee and 100 ml milk into a small pan. Melt over a very low heat, stirring occasionally, until it comes together into a smooth sauce. Remove from the heat and let it cool for 1–2 minutes until slightly thickened but still pourable.

3. Prepare the pastry strips: unroll one tube of ready-to-roll croissant dough. Pinch together the diagonal perforated seams, then divide the dough into three rectangles along the straight seams. Cut each rectangle into 4 long thin strips so you have 12 strips from that tube.

4. Fill and sandwich: drizzle a little of the toffee sauce along the length of each strip, then scatter some dark chocolate drops over the toffee. Unroll the second tube of croissant dough and cut it into the same-size strips. Place each plain strip on top of a toffee-chocolate strip to sandwich them together.

5. Shape the twirlies: holding the ends of each sandwich strip, twist tightly to form a curly twirly and lay it on the prepared baking sheets. They will expand slightly during baking—leave a little space between them.

6. Bake: once all the twirlies are shaped, bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until golden and crisp.

7. Finish and serve: dust lightly with golden icing sugar and serve fresh from the oven for best texture and flavor.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 45 minutes
Calories: 350 kcal

Ingredients
- 3 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp demerara sugar (use 3 tbsp for the filling and the remainder for dusting)
- 2 small eating apples, peeled, cored and diced
- Pinch each ground allspice and cinnamon
- 75 g blueberries
- 500 g pack puff pastry
- A little plain flour for rolling
- 1 egg, beaten

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the filling: In a medium saucepan, melt the 3 tbsp butter with 3 tbsp of the demerara sugar. Stir in the diced apples and the ground allspice and cinnamon. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the apples are slightly softened but not fully cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the blueberries. Set aside to cool slightly.

Total cooking time: 240 minutes
Calories (kcal): 0.0

- Light brown or 'teddy bear brown' food colouring paste
- Pink or 'fuschia' food colouring paste
- Blue or 'bluebell' food colouring paste
- Edible glue
- 500g icing sugar, sifted
- 250g unsalted butter, softened
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- 15cm (6"") cake tin and cake board
- 23cm (9"") cake tin and cake board
- 30cm (12"") cake drum
- A wide rolling pin
- A large smooth surface
- Cake smoother (optional)
- Toothpicks
- A paintbrush
- A small sieve or icing sugar dredger
- A 15cm cake box
- A 30cm cake box
- A selection of baby-themed biscuit cutters (teddy bear, duck, small rabbit). Note: cutters should not be over 7cm tall.

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Make the 15cm fruitcake.
   - You can bake this up to a month in advance. Wrap in cling film. Once a week you can ""feed"" it by poking holes in the top and spooning in a little dark rum or brandy.

2. Marzipan the fruitcake.
   - Heat the 200g apricot jam until bubbling, then remove from the heat. Sieve if necessary to remove any bits.
   - Level the top of the fruitcake using a long serrated bread knife. Brush the top with jam and flip the cake over and position it on the 15cm cake board.
   - Briefly knead the marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Roll out the marzipan into a circle (measure your fruitcake’s top and sides with string or a tape measure to know how far to roll).
   - Brush the cake with apricot jam and carefully transfer the marzipan to the cake. Gently smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, lifting and coaxing the marzipan so that it fits without overlapping.
   - When you reach the bottom edges, use a sharp knife to shave off any excess marzipan.
   - You can do this up to a month in advance.

3. Ice the cake drum.
   - Lightly knead 500g of the white ready-to-roll icing and form into a ball. Dust your work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll the icing into a circle large enough for the 30cm drum (use a tape measure to check).
   - Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the icing to the board. Gently roll over the board again, then trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Roll gently again if you like to get a really smooth finish.
   - Watch for fingerprints and bits of fluff as ready-to-roll icing can be delicate.
   - You can do this in advance and store the iced drum in a cake box to keep dust off.

4. Make the 23cm lemon cake.
   - The unfilled cake will keep well wrapped with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.

5. Make the lemon buttercream.
   - Beat together 250g unsalted butter, 500g sifted icing sugar and the finely grated zest of 1 lemon to make a buttercream. You can make this the day before icing.

6. Buttercream the 23cm lemon cake.
   - Level the top of the lemon cake using a long serrated bread knife.
   - Spread a little buttercream onto the 23cm cake board. Turn the cake upside down onto the board.
   - Brush all over with a thin layer of sieved apricot jam to help stop crumbs getting into the buttercream.
   - Cut the cake in half horizontally using the bread knife (it doesn't need to be perfect).
   - Spread a layer of buttercream on the cut side of the bottom half, replace the top layer and press down a little to level.
   - Spread the remaining buttercream on the top and sides using a palette knife to smooth the surface. Chill in the fridge until the buttercream is firm to make icing easier.

7. Cover both cakes in ready-to-roll icing.
   - You’ll need approximately 500g for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one.
   - For each cake, gently work the icing into a ball. Dust the surface with icing sugar and roll it into a circle large enough to cover the cake (use a tape measure or string).
   - For the fruitcake: brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, then transfer and smooth the icing over it just as you did the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one.
   - For the lemon cake: the buttercream will act as the ""glue"" so you can transfer the icing directly and smooth it over the cake.
   - Trim the icing carefully around the bases. A ribbon around the bottom will hide any imperfections.
   - Save any leftover icing for decorations. Wrap it in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag to seal out air.

8. Prepare support dowels for stacking.
   - Use three plastic dowels to keep the cake stable and level. Insert three dowels in a triangle pattern about 2cm in from where the edges of the smaller cake will be.
   - With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on each dowel. Pull the dowels out, line them up and note the highest mark — that is the length you want all dowels to be.
   - Score and cut the dowels to that length and reinsert them, rounded end down.

9. Stack the cakes.
   - Smooth a little leftover buttercream onto the top of the larger cake where the dowels are.
   - Pick the best side of the smaller cake (this will be the front) and carefully lift it onto the larger cake. Use a palette knife to help lower it if needed.

10. Colour your leftover icing for decorations.
    - Pinch off a small ball of icing and leave it white for contrast.
    - Divide the remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown (teddy bear brown) by adding small amounts of brown colouring paste with a toothpick and kneading until even.
    - Dye the remaining two balls into pastel colours (pink/fuchsia and blue/bluebell) in the same gradual way.
    - Wrap all coloured balls in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag until ready to use to prevent crusting.

11. Create border cut-outs for the tiers.
    - For the bottom (23cm) tier: roll out the appropriate coloured icing and cut approximately 12 shapes (example: six brown teddies alternating with three pink ducks and three blue ducks — spacing depends on your cutter sizes).
    - Use a paintbrush to apply a little edible glue to the back of each shape and stick them evenly around the cake.
    - For the top (15cm) tier: cut out 12 small bunnies, alternating brown, blue, pink, etc. Stick these around the tier with edible glue.

12. Make the teddy topper and rabbit companion.
    - For the teddy: roll a small ball for the head and a slightly larger ball for the body. Stick the head on top of the body. Roll two icing sausages (one for legs, one for arms), cut in half, stick the arms to the sides of the body and flatten the ends to form paws; stick the legs and flatten ends to form feet. Make two small flattened balls for ears and attach. Make a small white ball for the muzzle and stick to the face. Use a toothpick dipped in brown colouring paste for two eye dots. Roll tiny brown balls for the nose and tiny white balls for buttons and stick them on. Optionally add white pads for the feet and inner ears.
    - For the rabbit: roll a sausage of pink or blue icing, snip the top and bottom one third along. Form the top into ears and the bottom into legs. Pinch a neck about 1 cm under the ears, snip each side upwards from the legs to just below the neck to form arms and mould slightly. Use a toothpick dipped in brown paste to draw eyes, nose and whiskers.
    - Sit the teddy on top of the cake and place the rabbit in his lap.

13. Final touches.
    - If you like and are confident with writing icing, write the child's name on the second tier or stick a candle there.
    - Arrange any final decorative details as desired.

Serving and storage:
- The fruitcake can be made and marzipanned up to a month in advance; feed weekly if you wish.
- The lemon cake can be made up to 4 days ahead (or frozen up to a month).
- Store finished cake chilled if it contains buttercream, and bring to room temperature before serving for best texture.

- 300g unsalted butter, room temperature
- 300g caster sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 6 large eggs
- 400g self-raising flour
- 130g natural yogurt
- 2 tbsp milk (if needed)
- 50g caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 250g unsalted butter, softened
- 550g icing sugar
- 75g orange curd
- 3 tbsp raspberry jam
- 500g red sugarpaste
- 250g yellow sugarpaste
- 140g blue sugarpaste
- 100g brown sugarpaste
- 25g black sugarpaste
- 80cm length of yellow ribbon (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/gas 4. Lightly grease a 23cm deep round cake pan and line the base with parchment paper.

2. Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, cream 300g unsalted butter and 300g caster sugar together using an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy (about 10 minutes). Add 2 tsp vanilla extract and whisk to combine.

3. Beat the 6 large eggs a little with a fork. With the beaters still running, add the eggs a little at a time, waiting until each addition is fully combined before adding more.

4. Fold in the 400g self-raising flour with a spatula in three additions, alternating with the 130g natural yogurt. If the finished batter feels a little stiff, mix in a couple of tablespoons of milk to loosen it.

5. Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and level the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover loosely with baking parchment for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 minutes.

6. While the cake is cooling in the tin, make the syrup: place 50g caster sugar, 50ml water and 1 tsp vanilla extract into a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few minutes until the sugar has dissolved.

7. Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely. Use a skewer to poke holes all over the top of the cake and use a pastry brush to spread the syrup over the top, allowing it to soak into the sponge before adding more.

8. Make the buttercream: beat 250g unsalted butter (softened) and 550g icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then add 75g orange curd and whisk again to combine.

9. If the cake is domed on top, level it with a large serrated knife. Cut the cake through the middle into two layers. Place the bottom layer onto a 23cm round cake board and spread a thin layer of the buttercream on it, then spread 3 tbsp raspberry jam over the buttercream. Place the second layer of cake on top and spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake.

10. Cover and decorate with sugarpaste:
   - On a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, knead the 500g red sugarpaste until soft and pliable. Roll it out to about 3–4mm thick and wide enough to cover the cake. Roll the sugarpaste onto a rolling pin and carefully drape it over the cake. Gently smooth it down the sides and trim off excess with a small sharp knife. Reserve trimmings for later details.
   - Roll out the 250g yellow sugarpaste to the same thickness and cut into thin strips. Cut about 30 strips, approx. 1.5cm x 10cm, and stick them to the sides of the cake all the way around, dipping your finger in water to brush onto the back of each strip (water acts as glue). The strips should cover the entire height of the cake but only reach a couple of centimetres over the top.
   - Roll out the 140g blue sugarpaste to the same thickness and cut out a 20cm circle. Stick it in place in the middle of the cake using a little water.

11. Shape Duggee's face and details:
   - Roll out the 100g brown sugarpaste and use a thin sharp knife to cut out Duggee’s face, attaching it to the blue circle with a little water.
   - For Duggee’s clothes, knead a little yellow into some of the remaining brown sugarpaste until it becomes a light brown colour; use this to cut out his shirt and lip area and stick in place with a little water.
   - Use the 25g black sugarpaste to form his eyes and nose (use your hands rather than rolling on the work surface). Use remaining sugarpaste to shape decorations for his outfit and mouth, attaching them with a little water.

12. Optional finishing touch: wrap the 80cm length of yellow ribbon around the bottom edge of the cake and secure with tape or a pin (remember to remove before serving).

Storage: This cake will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 days.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a complete Hey Duggee cake recipe featuring red, yellow, and blue sugarpaste, addressing the user’s request for a challenging kids' birthday cake with multiple colored sugarpaste in a Hey Duggee style."

- large round cake board or a large flat plate, about 13 inches / 33 cm
- 2 plastic diggers and one dumper truck, or similar toys
- 9 four-finger KitKat bars
- handful Smarties or other coloured sweets
- marker pen
- 10 x 5 cm rectangle of yellow cardboard
- 1 drinking straw
- sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Heat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C) / gas 4. Use a little of the butter to grease the sides and bases of two 20 cm sandwich tins. Melt the rest of the butter in a small saucepan. Off the heat, add the milk, yogurt and vanilla, followed by the eggs. Beat well with a fork.

2. Put the dry ingredients (self-raising flour, light muscovado sugar, baking powder, 50g cocoa powder and ¼ tsp salt) into a large bowl. Whisk to combine – this aerates and saves sifting. Tip in the wet ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter.

3. Don’t hang around at this point. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared tins and put onto the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for 25 minutes or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the tins, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack.

4. Make the buttercream. Stir the 2 tbsp cocoa powder into 2 tbsp milk until smooth. Put the 200g softened butter into a large bowl and sift the 300g icing sugar on top. Add the cocoa mixture, 1 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat for a few minutes with electric beaters until creamy and spreadable. Add the extra 1 tsp milk if you need to.

5. Place one of the cakes towards the back of the board or plate, and fix it with a little of the buttercream to stop it slipping about. Spread it with ¼ of the buttercream.

6. Sandwich the second cake on top. With a small, serrated knife, cut away a scallop-shaped crater from the top cake. Cut about halfway down into the sponge and remove about a quarter of the top of the cake. Keep the piece you remove. Position two diggers on the top of the cake to see if your crater is about the right size and shape, then set them aside again.

7. Using a palette knife, paddle the rest of the buttercream evenly over the top of the cake and down its sides. Make sure that the edge of the excavated area is defined.

8. Snap the ends from enough of the KitKat fingers to follow the edge of the excavated area, then press them into the buttercream. Now fix the rest of the whole fingers around the side of the cake.

9. Crumble the cake piece you removed in step 6 to make ""soil."" Part-fill the excavated hole with the crumbs, adding a few Smarties if you like. Position the diggers on top and put some soil and Smarties into their buckets.

10. Fill a lorry or dump truck toy with more crumbs and Smarties, and let some of the soil spill over the edge of the cake and the broken KitKats for a realistic effect.

11. Use the marker to write your message on the yellow card and draw some diagonal black lines. Cut the straight part of the straw into two equal pieces, then fix these to the back of the card with sticky tape to make a sign. Position the sign at the back of the cake.

Storage note: If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for 2 days.",RELEVANT,"The answer directly lists ingredients and decorations (KitKat bars, Smarties, toy diggers/dumper, etc.) required to make the Digger cake, addressing the user's query."

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 35 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 320g pack ready-rolled shortcrust pastry
- 100g crème fraîche
- 1 lemon, zested
- 2 tsp horseradish
- 2 tbsp chopped chives
- 2 eggs, plus 1 egg yolk
- 3 tbsp milk
- 100g smoked trout, thinly sliced
- salt and black pepper (to season)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 200°C / 180°C fan / gas 6. Unroll the pastry and, keeping it on its paper, cut out 12 discs of pastry using a 7cm round cutter. Use the pastry discs to line a 12-hole shallow tart tin. Put the tin in the fridge to chill while you make the filling.

2. In a large jug, combine the crème fraîche, lemon zest, horseradish, chopped chives, the 2 eggs (plus 1 egg yolk), and the 3 tbsp milk. Season well with a little pinch of salt (the trout is already quite salty) and a good grinding of black pepper. Mix well to combine, ensuring there are no lumps of crème fraîche or egg.

3. Remove the tin from the fridge and divide the smoked trout between the pastry cases.

4. Carefully pour the crème fraîche mixture over the trout in the cases, leaving a 1–2 mm rim of pastry at the top. It helps to give the mixture a stir after each pour so the chives and lemon zest don’t sink to the bottom.

63c96abe-b75d-4297-8dff-ea53508b25fe,How do I make a show-stopping mermaid cake using a mermaid tail and shell mould with white chocolate and gold lustre decorations?,"Recipe name: Mermaid cake

Difficulty: A challenge

Total cooking time: 120 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 300 g butter, softened, plus extra for the tins
- 300 g caster sugar
- 5 large eggs, beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 300 g self-raising flour
- Purple gel food colouring (or a mixture of purple, blue and red gel colouring)
- 700 g icing sugar
- 350 g butter, softened
- Blue or purple gel food colouring
- Edible pearls and silver sprinkles (or extra optional decoration)
- 200 g white chocolate
- 2 tsp gold or metallic lustre (see tip below)
- Mermaid tail mould and small shell moulds (available online)

Step-by-step instructions

1. Make the white chocolate mermaid tails and shells
   - Break or chop the 200 g white chocolate and melt in a heatproof bowl in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each turn until smooth.
   - Pour the melted white chocolate into the mermaid tail moulds and the small shell moulds. Place the filled moulds flat on a small tray and put them in the freezer for 15–20 minutes until set.
   - If you only have one mould, repeat the filling-and-freezing step until you have the number of tails/shells you need.

2. Paint the tails with gold lustre
   - Once set, remove the chocolate shapes from the moulds.
   - Mix the 2 tsp gold or metallic lustre with 1/4 tsp water to make a paintable mixture.
   - Paint the lustre onto the mermaid tails (and shells if desired). Return them to a plate or tray and keep in the freezer until needed.

3. Prepare and bake the sponge layers
   - Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / Gas 4. Butter and line the base of three 18 cm sandwich cake tins with baking parchment.
   - In a stand mixer or with an electric hand whisk, beat together 300 g softened butter, 300 g caster sugar, the 5 beaten eggs, 1 tsp vanilla bean paste, 1 tsp baking powder and 300 g self-raising flour until you have a light, fluffy batter.
   - Divide the batter evenly between three bowls. Add a few drops of colouring into each bowl to make three different shades of purple, getting lighter for each bowl.
   - Pour each coloured sponge mix into separate tins and smooth the tops.
   - Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
   - After 10 minutes, remove the cakes from their tins and transfer to a cooling rack, top-side facing down, and leave to cool. (Don’t worry if the outside doesn’t look purple — the inside will.)

4. Make the buttercream icing
   - Beat together 700 g icing sugar and 350 g softened butter until pale and fluffy. If needed, mix in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture.
   - Set half of this icing aside in a separate bowl (this will remain white). Divide the remaining half between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue: dark, medium and light.

5. Assemble and crumb-coat the cake
   - Stack the sponges, spreading most of the reserved white icing between each layer using a palette knife.
   - Use the remainder of the white icing to roughly coat the outside of the stacked cake to create a crumb coat.
   - Chill the crumb-coated cake for 30 minutes.

6. Create the ombré piped exterior
   - Put each blue icing shade into separate piping bags and cut a large 2 cm hole at the bottom of each bag.
   - Starting with the darkest shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring around the whole cake, going two to three times around. Continue working up the cake with progressively lighter shades until you reach the top.
   - Use a small palette knife to work around the joins between each piped ring, gently pushing to join each line together.
   - Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top.

7. Smooth and decorate the top
   - Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombré finish, keeping the excess icing to decorate the top.
   - You can either mix all leftover icing together and put it in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle for a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top.
   - Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (use some white to mimic the top of a crashing wave).

8. Add finishing touches
   - Dot around the edible pearls, silver sprinkles, chocolate shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake and on top to finish.
   - Keep the painted white chocolate mermaid tails refrigerated or frozen until just before decorating so they retain their sheen and shape.

Tips
- Mix the gold lustre carefully with very little water — you want a paintable consistency so it adheres to the chocolate without running.
- If you only have one mermaid tail mould, make tails in batches and store them frozen until needed.
- Chill the cake between stages if the buttercream becomes too soft while working.

- 250g royal icing made from packet royal icing sugar (use 250g sugar)
- blue food colouring
- 1 chocolate stick (we used Mikado) (optional)
- 30 x 20cm cake tin
- 30cm square cake board (preferably blue)
- 2 sheets black, white or blue paper
- 2 drinking straws
- 2 sandwich flags

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 160°C / 140°C fan / gas 3. Grease and line a 30 x 20cm cake tin with baking parchment.

2. Put the butter and 200g of the chocolate into a saucepan and heat gently until melted. Remove from the heat.

3. Sieve the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl. Mix in the sugar.

4. Beat together the eggs, soured cream and vanilla extract. Pour the chocolate and egg mixtures into the flour and sugar and beat well until smooth.

5. Pour into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes. Leave until completely cold before cutting and shaping.

6. Cut the cake in half lengthways. Place one complete half on the 30cm cake board.

7. Cut the remaining half into 3 rectangles: 13 x 10cm, 7 x 10cm and 10 x 10cm. Attach the 10 x 10cm piece to one end of the base cake using a little warm apricot jam. Cut a ‘V’ shape to represent the prow of the ship.

8. Place the 13 x 10cm piece at the other end of the base cake, attaching with jam. Using jam again attach the 7 x 10cm piece on top of the 13 x 10cm piece to make the upper deck. Slice the back of the ship at a very slight angle.

9. Brush the whole cake with apricot jam.

10. Roll out about 550g of the ready-to-roll icing and cover the cake. Trim the edges at the base and keep any trimmings.

11. Melt the remaining 100g chocolate in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Use melted chocolate to stick the mini Toblerones to the edges of the two decks and to the ‘V’ shape of the prow. Trim any to fit exactly.

12. Use the melted chocolate to stick on the chocolate balls for cannon balls, stack finger biscuits as cannons and stick chocolate caramels (Rolos) for portholes. Using a little of the marzipan, roll out and cut four windows. Make window frames from brown icing trimmings, rolling out to thin sausages to form a cross and sticking with chocolate. Attach to the sides of the ship with chocolate.

13. Poke the chocolate stick out of the front of the prow, if using.

14. Arrange the chocolate coins in a little pile on the cake board, reserving 3 or 4 coins for the top. Roll out the remaining brown icing and cover the coins completely. Brush with melted chocolate and sprinkle with muscovado sugar. Push 3 or 4 coins into the “sand” along with the chocolate skull if using.

15. Put a little of the royal icing in a bowl. Colour the remainder blue with the blue food colouring. Spread the blue icing on the cake board around the ship and the island. Use the white royal icing to make ‘surf’ around the edge of the island.

16. Using the remaining marzipan and brown icing, make three barrels. Place one on the deck of the ship and the others in the sea.

17. Cut out sails from the paper and make holes in them so you can push the straws through. Attach the sails to the ship and poke sandwich flags out of the top to finish.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 125 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 2 tsp each coriander and cumin seeds
- 1 tsp paprika, plus extra for dusting
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 150ml (¼ pint) olive oil
- 900g squash, peeled and cut into small chunks (about 2cm)
- 12 shallots, quartered
- 4cm (1½ in) piece root ginger, finely chopped
- 140g whole blanched almonds
- 140g shelled pistachios
- 75g pack dried cranberries
- 6 tbsp clear honey (divided: 2 tbsp used in filling, 4 tbsp for finishing)
- 225g pack fresh spinach
- 400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- 4 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
- 100g butter
- 8 large sheets filo pastry
- Lemon wedges, to serve
- 200g carton Greek yogurt
- 6 tbsp milk
- 3 large sprigs mint, leaves chopped
- 2–3 tbsp harissa paste

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to fan 180°C / conventional 200°C / gas 6.

2. Toast the seeds: Dry-fry the coriander and cumin seeds briefly in a small pan over medium heat until toasty (don’t let them burn). Grind coarsely in a pestle and mortar (or a bowl and the end of a rolling pin). Mix the ground seeds with the paprika, ground cinnamon, ½ tsp salt and 4 tbsp of the olive oil to make a spiced oil.

3. Roast the squash: Tip the squash into a roasting tin, pour over the spiced oil and toss to coat. Roast for 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, prepare the shallot-nut-berry-spinach mixture: Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan. Add the quartered shallots and cook, stirring, until they start to brown. Stir in the finely chopped ginger and 100g (4oz) each of the almonds and pistachios. When the nuts brown, toss in the dried cranberries, 2 tbsp honey and the spinach so it wilts. Take off the heat.

5. Combine roast and sautéed mixtures: When the squash comes out of the oven, toss it together with the shallot/nut/cranberry/spinach mixture. Set this combined squash mixture aside.

6. Make the hummus layer: In a food processor, whizz the drained chickpeas with the garlic, 1 tsp ground cumin, the remaining olive oil, lemon juice, 2 tbsp water and salt and pepper to taste until smooth to make a houmous. Stir in the chopped fresh coriander.

7. Prepare the filo tin: Melt the butter in a small pan. Put a loose-bottomed 28cm quiche tin on a baking sheet and brush with some melted butter. Keep the filo covered with a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out.

8. Layer the filo: Lay one sheet of filo over half of the tin so it hangs over the edge by about 10cm. Lay another sheet on the opposite side so it overlaps the first in the centre and hangs over the opposite edge. Brush with butter. Lay two more filo sheets in the opposite direction the same way and brush with more butter. Build up two more layers in this way so you use a total of eight sheets of filo (brushing with butter between sheets).

9. Fill the pie: Pile half the squash mixture in the centre of the pastry. Spread the houmous over that, then top with the remaining squash mixture.

10. Fold the pastry: One sheet at a time, bring the edge of each filo sheet up to the centre to cover the filling, creating voluptuous folds as you go. Brush carefully with more melted butter as you work to help the pastry seal and turn golden.

11. (Make-ahead option) If making a day ahead, cover the assembled pie now with cling film and chill. To reheat, remove the pie from the fridge, heat the oven and then bake for 35–40 minutes.

12. Bake: Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 30–35 minutes, until the filo is crisp and golden.

13. Finish with glazed nuts and honey: Just before the pie is ready, reheat any remaining butter in the pan, tip in the remaining nuts (the leftover 40g each?) and fry until golden. Spoon in the remaining 4 tbsp honey and, when it melts, take off the heat and pour the honeyed nuts over the baked pie.

14. Make the Harissa yogurt sauce: Mix the Greek yogurt and milk together to make a thin sauce. Stir in the chopped mint and season with salt and pepper. Swirl in harissa paste to taste (adjust quantity depending on how spicy you want it).

15. Serve: Cut the pie into wedges, drizzle with any extra honeyed nuts from step 13, and serve with the Harissa yogurt sauce and lemon wedges.

3. Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and leave to cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Finely slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan with the onions. Cook until the onions and mushrooms are almost done.
5. Add the flour to the pan and stir to make a thick paste (a roux). Crumble in the chicken stock cube and stir well.
6. Continuously stir the roux over a low heat for 2 minutes to cook out the flour—this helps prevent a starchy taste.
7. Slowly add the warm milk to the pan, stirring all the time. Once all the milk is added, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and mustard powder. Add the bay leaf and bring to the boil, stirring constantly to stop lumps forming.
8. When the sauce has thickened, add more milk or water if needed to reach the desired consistency. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a very low heat.
9. Chop the cooked chicken into even-sized pieces and add to the sauce. Stir in your chosen mixed vegetables. Pour the filling into the pie dish.
10. Put the pastry on a clean, floured surface and dust the rolling pin. Roll out the pastry, being careful not to tear it.
11. Measure the pastry against the pie dish; when it's slightly larger than the top, lift it carefully over the dish (using the rolling pin can help). Trim off any excess pastry hanging over the edge.
12. Press the pastry edge with a fork or your fingers to seal and create a pattern.
13. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg or milk. Make a small hole in the centre of the pastry top to allow steam to escape. Use any leftover pastry to decorate the top if you like.
14. Place the pie in the oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown.

5b3dfe71-483d-49dd-879d-976588bd3ec9,Quick show-stopping vanilla sponge dinosaur cake recipe for kids that takes about 45 minutes total?,"Recipe name: Dinosaur cake

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 45 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 250g pack unsalted butter (some for greasing, rest for melting)
- 50ml whole milk
- 150g whole natural yogurt
- ½ tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 3 large eggs
- 250g white caster sugar
- 300g self-raising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 300g unsalted butter, very well softened (for buttercream)
- 450g icing sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 2 tsp whole milk (for buttercream)
- 2 heaped tbsp raspberry jam (or lemon curd)
- 1kg white sugarpaste
- Green and pink food colouring paste (e.g. Sugarflair Spring Green and Fuchsia)
- A little icing sugar, sifted, for rolling out
- 38g tube Smarties
- 22 inch / 55 cm square cake board
- 100g royal icing sugar
- 100g desiccated coconut
- Blue food colouring paste
- 100g chocolate sprinkles
- (Optional: a pinch of salt for dry mix)

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C/gas 4). Grease the sides and bases of two 20cm sandwich tins with a little of the butter from the 250g pack.

2. Melt the remainder of the 250g butter in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and immediately add the 50ml whole milk, 150g yogurt and ½ tsp vanilla. Add the 3 eggs and beat well with a fork until combined.

3. In a large bowl, put the dry ingredients: 300g self-raising flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 250g caster sugar and (optional) ¼ tsp salt. Whisk to combine—this aerates the mix and saves sifting.

4. Tip the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter.

5. Pour the batter evenly into the two prepared tins and put onto the middle shelf of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

6. Cool the cakes in their tins for 10 minutes, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack.

7. While the cakes cool, make the buttercream: put the 300g very soft butter into a large bowl and sift the 450g icing sugar on top. Add 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp whole milk and a pinch of salt, then beat for a few minutes with electric beaters until creamy, pale and spreadable.

8. Sandwich the cakes with just under 1/4 of the buttercream and then spread the jam (or lemon curd) over the filling.

9. Mark the assembled cake into six equal wedges and cut out two of the wedges. These two cut wedges will form the dinosaur’s face. Chill all of the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up the crumbs—this makes icing easier.

10. While the cake chills, colour the remaining buttercream with a little green food colouring gel.

11. Split the 1kg white sugarpaste into four pieces: one 500g, one 250g, one 150g and one 100g. Colour the 250g piece green to make the legs and arms. Colour the 150g piece pink to make the spines.

12. Place the chilled cakes on the 22-inch cake board. Use a little buttercream to anchor them in position: the main assembled sponge becomes the dinosaur body and the two cut wedges form the face.

13. Shape the 500g piece of sugarpaste to make a tail—taper it at the end. Flatten the other end so it fits onto the tail part of the cake (the piece will look a bit like a witch’s hat at this point). Drape and mould it over the tail area of the sponge.

14. Using a palette knife, spread the coloured green buttercream over each piece of cake and over the tail to give an even coloured surface to stick decorations to.

15. Shape 100g of the white icing into small circles for eyes and small triangles for teeth, then press them into the buttercream in position on the face area.

16. Shape two small sausages from green sugarpaste to make an arm, add two small claws, and position on the cake. Shape the remaining green sugarpaste into two legs, add claws if you like, and press them into the buttercream on the dinosaur’s belly.

17. Shape the pink icing into spikes and position them along the spine and under the tail. You can also make small pink sausages for eyelids if you like.

18. Press the Smarties all over the dinosaur’s body, saving two Smarties for the eyes if you didn’t use white icing for the eyeballs. Leave the decorated dinosaur to set.

19. To cover the board: tint the 100g desiccated coconut with a few drops of blue food colouring until even. Mix the 100g royal icing sugar with about 2 tbsp water to make a brushable glaze, then brush this all over the cake board and around the dinosaur.

20. Sprinkle the coloured coconut and the 100g chocolate sprinkles around the dinosaur on the board and leave to set.

Storage: If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for up to 3 days.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 95 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 150ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 200g plain flour
- 8 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 280g light brown soft sugar
- 200ml buttermilk
- 100ml strong coffee or espresso
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2½ x 114g packs milk chocolate fingers
- 8 tubes of sugar coated chocolates, or other sweets
- 100g milk chocolate, chopped into small pieces, plus 50g/2oz for decorating
- 200g slightly salted butter, softened
- 400g icing sugar, sieved
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 bendy straw
- 2 wooden skewers
- 1 paper bag or sweet packet (see tip)
- sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas mark 4. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. If your tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm.

2. In a bowl, mix the plain flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt. Break up any lumps in the sugar with your fingers.

3. In a jug measure the 200ml buttermilk, 100ml strong coffee, 150ml vegetable oil and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the 2 large eggs and whisk until smooth.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared tins.

5. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until the sponges have risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool. (Sponges can be made up to three days ahead—wrap in cling film—or freeze for up to two months.)

6. To make the chocolate fudge icing: place 100g milk chocolate (chopped) in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water and stir until melted (or melt in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring between bursts). Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

7. Meanwhile, put 200g slightly salted butter and 400g sieved icing sugar in a large bowl and mash with a spatula to combine, then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth. Sift in 4 tbsp cocoa powder, pour in the melted chocolate and add 2 tbsp milk, then mix again until smooth.

8. Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the two sponges together on a cake stand or board. Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing—don’t worry about being too neat.

9. Immediately press the milk chocolate fingers upright around the sides of the cake. Do this straight after icing while the icing is still tacky so the fingers will stick.

10. Melt the remaining 50g chocolate in the microwave or over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave to cool until it reaches a spreadable consistency (you can chill briefly in the fridge, stirring every 5 minutes to keep it spreadable).

11. For the “gravity-defying” sweets column: push one wooden skewer into the centre of the cake and slip the bendy straw over the skewer—this gives extra stability. Push 1–2cm of the straw into the cake.

12. Using a cutlery knife, spread a blob of the melted decorating chocolate onto a sugar‑coated chocolate sweet and press it onto the straw at the base. Work in stages, allowing the chocolate to set a little between layers, building up sweets around the straw until it’s completely covered. If the chocolate gets too firm, reheat briefly to the right consistency. Stop when you reach the bend in the straw.

13. Stick the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so that it pokes out at an angle. Place the paper bag or sweet packet on top of the skewer—you may need a little sticky tape to hold it in place. If any straw is exposed, cover with more sweets.

14. Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface and hide any joins.

Storage: Will keep well stored in an airtight tin for 2 days.

Difficulty level: More effort

Ingredients:
- 250g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 30g caster sugar
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 100ml lukewarm milk
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 50g butter, softened
- Vegetable oil, for deep-frying
- 100g caster sugar (for coating)
- 1 tsp cinnamon (optional, for cinnamon sugar)
- 200g icing sugar (for glaze)
- Sprinkles, freeze-dried raspberries or chocolate curls, to decorate (optional)

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Tip the flour, sugar, yeast and 1 tsp salt into a bowl and mix to combine. Pour in the milk, beaten egg and vanilla, and bring everything together with your hands into a rough dough, making sure all the flour is mixed in. (Alternatively, use a stand mixer.)
2. Cover the bowl with a clean, damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.
3. Tip the dough onto a clean surface and knead for 10–15 minutes by hand or 5–8 minutes in a stand mixer on low speed until springy and glossy.
4. Use your hands to work the softened butter into the dough — this will take about 5 minutes. At first it may look like it’s not coming together, but keep working the dough through your fingers until it becomes smooth and glossy.
5. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover and leave in a warm place to prove for 2–3 hours, or until nearly doubled in size. (Line a baking tray with baking parchment.)
6. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 2 cm thickness, then use a 9 cm cutter to stamp out as many circles as you can. Use a 4 cm cutter to stamp out the middles.
7. Re-roll the trimmings (including the middles) and stamp out more rings (you should end up with about six ring doughnuts). Re-roll any remaining trimmings and use the 4 cm cutter to stamp out five or six mini bites.
8. Put the doughnuts and bites on the prepared tray, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for another 2–3 hours (or in the fridge overnight) until doubled in size. Note: the lightness of the doughnuts depends on this second proving; a longer prove in the fridge develops more flavour.
9. Fill a deep-fat fryer following manufacturer’s instructions, or use a heavy-based pan, ensuring it is no more than a third full of oil. Heat to 170°C or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in about 30 seconds.
10. Carefully lift two or three doughnuts from the tray and slide them into the hot oil using a floured spatula. Fry for about 2 minutes on each side until puffed up and golden brown.
11. Remove the doughnuts to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon or tongs. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, then fry all the mini bites for a total of about 2 minutes.
12. When the doughnuts and bites have cooled, either coat them in sugar or glaze them:
    - For sugar doughnuts: combine 100g caster sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon, then toss the warm doughnuts in the mixture.
    - For glazed doughnuts: sift 200g icing sugar into a bowl and mix in about 2 tbsp cold water until you have a runny icing. Dip the doughnuts and decorate with sprinkles, freeze-dried raspberries or chocolate curls if desired.
13. Best eaten straightaway. They will keep in an airtight container for a day.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 40 minutes
Calories: 377 kcal

Ingredients
- 500 g floury potato, cut into chunks
- 200 g frozen peas
- 4–5 tsp curry powder (choose your favourite)
- 200 ml natural yogurt
- Small bunch mint, half roughly chopped (for the yogurt) and the rest left as leaves
- 6 white or wholemeal pitta breads, halved
- ½ iceberg lettuce, shredded, to serve
- ½ red onion, sliced
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Baking parchment and a baking sheet

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (fan 180°C / gas 6). Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.
2. Put the potato chunks into a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. After the potatoes have boiled for about 5 minutes, add the frozen peas and continue boiling for a further 3–4 minutes until the potatoes are tender and the peas are cooked.
3. Drain well. Remove the potatoes from the sieve first and return them to the saucepan with about one-third of the peas.
4. Add the curry powder and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mash the potatoes and peas together over a low heat — this helps to dry out the mixture so the pakoras hold together. Stir in the remaining peas so they’re distributed through the mash.
5. Using 2 tablespoons, shape the mixture into rough rugby-ball shapes (you should get about 16 pakoras). Place them on the prepared baking sheet spaced a little apart.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, until golden and crisp around the edges.
7. While the pakoras are baking, make the mint yogurt dressing: mix the natural yogurt with the roughly chopped half-bunch of mint and season to taste.
8. Warm the halved pittas briefly in the oven or a toaster so they’re easy to open.
9. Toss the remaining mint leaves with the shredded iceberg lettuce. Have the sliced red onion ready for stuffing.
10. When the pakoras are hot and golden, stuff the warmed pittas with lettuce and mint leaves, a few pakoras, some sliced red onion, and a generous spoonful of the mint yogurt dressing. Serve immediately.

- 480g unsalted butter, softened (for buttercream)
- 6 tbsp maple syrup (to flavour the buttercream)
- Edible gold spray (optional), to decorate

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4.
   - Grease and line the bases of 3 x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment; grease the parchment too.

2. Make the sponges
   - Put the 225g softened butter and both sugars (175g golden caster and 175g light brown soft sugar) in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the 4 eggs, a little at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding more.
   - In another bowl, mix together 325g plain flour, 25g cornflour, 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp mixed spice and 1½ tbsp baking powder.
   - Stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the 300ml full-fat milk.
   - Divide the batter evenly among the prepared tins, smooth the surfaces.
   - Bake for 25–30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
   - Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peeling off the parchment, and cool completely.

3. Make the caramelised pears
   - Peel, core and dice the 4 conference pears into small cubes, tossing with the juice of 0.5 lemon as you go.
   - Tip the diced pears into a frying pan with 3 tbsp maple syrup and 2 tbsp unsalted butter.
   - Cook over medium-high heat until the pears have softened and most of the liquid has evaporated.
   - Set aside to cool. Discard any excess liquid before using.

4. Make the maple Swiss meringue buttercream
   - Put the 4 large egg whites and 320g light brown soft sugar in a large heatproof bowl (the bowl of a tabletop mixer works well). Place the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water (bain-marie).
   - Whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved — test by rubbing a little mixture between two fingers; if no grittiness remains it's ready.
   - Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with an electric whisk (or mixer) until a thick, glossy meringue has formed and it has cooled to room temperature.
   - With the mixer running, slowly beat in the 480g softened unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have a silky-smooth buttercream. If the mixture looks curdled or too soft, continue whisking until it comes together; if it’s still too warm, chill 10 minutes then continue.
   - Whisk in the 6 tbsp maple syrup last to flavour the buttercream.

5. Assemble the cake
   - Place the first sponge on a cake board or serving plate and spread a thin layer of buttercream over the top.
   - Scatter half of the cooled caramelised pear chunks over that buttercream (discard any leftover liquid).
   - Add the second sponge, repeat with a thin layer of buttercream and the remaining caramelised pear chunks.
   - Top with the third sponge.

6. Crumb coat and ruffle finish
   - Spread a very thin layer of buttercream over the sides and top of the stacked cake to seal in crumbs (crumb-coat).
   - Now spread a thicker layer of buttercream over the top surface of the cake.
   - Fit the remaining buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a small petal piping tip (or a small petal/nozzle). Hold the piping bag so the wide end of the petal tip touches the side of the cake at the very bottom. Gently wiggle the bag side to side in a small zigzag motion while moving upward, piping a vertical strip. Repeat, starting next to the previous strip, working all the way around the cake until the sides are completely covered in ruffled strips.
   - Pipe one row of buttercream around the top edge of the cake to neaten any rough edges from the zigzag ruffles.

7. Decorate
   - If desired, finish with a light coat of edible gold spray for sparkle. Allow the cake to settle briefly before serving.

8. Serving and storage
   - Best served within 2 days of baking, though the cake will keep for up to 4 days if stored properly.

Notes
- The recipe uses a Swiss meringue buttercream (requires heating egg whites and sugar over simmering water and whipping to a cooled meringue before adding butter).

- 600 g icing sugar
- 280 g tub full-fat cream cheese
- 2 tsp vanilla extract (for the icing)
- 10 filled chocolate biscuits (about ¾ of a pack) for mixing into the icing
- Filled chocolate biscuits (extra, as many as you need for the letters on top; some may break when you insert the skewers, so buy extra)
- Thin wooden skewers
- 100 g white chocolate, finely chopped
- Ready-to-roll fondant icing, coloured (or an icing writing pen) — used to make letters/toppers (the recipe used a mixture of blue and green food colouring)

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat and prepare tins
- Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4.
- Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment. If your cake tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. Make the first cake batter
- In a bowl, mix 200 g plain flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280 g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt. Break up any lumps in the sugar.

3. Combine wet ingredients for the first batch
- In a jug measure 200 ml buttermilk, 100 ml coffee, 150 ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth.
- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined.
- Divide the mixture evenly between the two prepared tins.

4. Bake and cool
- Bake the tins for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
- Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.

5. Repeat to make a total of four sponges
- Repeat steps 2–4 to make two more sponge layers so you have 4 sponge cakes in total.
- Note: These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months.

6. Make the cream cheese biscuit icing
- Put the 250 g softened butter in a large bowl and sieve in half (300 g) of the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth.

- Put the 10 filled chocolate biscuits in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix until evenly combined.

7. Make cookie cake toppers (optional decorative step)
- You’ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you’d like to write (name, ‘WOW!’ etc.). Carefully insert a thin wooden skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit — some cookies may break, so save broken ones for decoration.
- Melt the 100 g white chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, or melt in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water.
- Spread a little melted chocolate over the surface of one side of each biscuit.
- Roll out the ready-to-roll fondant to the thickness of a 50p coin and cut out letters; stick these to the chocolate-covered side of the biscuits and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry and use an icing pen to write directly on the biscuit surface.

8. Assemble the cake
- Stick one sponge to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese biscuit icing.
- Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining sponges on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer.
- Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake.

9. Finish and decorate
- If you have leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and press them around the base of the cake.

- 10 filled chocolate biscuits (about ¾ of a pack) (for toppers)
- Additional filled chocolate biscuits, as many as you need for the letters on top (some may break when you insert the skewers, so buy extra)
- Thin wooden skewers
- 100 g white chocolate, finely chopped
- Ready-to-roll fondant icing, coloured (a mixture of blue and green food colouring was used), or an icing writing pen

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.
   - Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment — if your tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. Make the dry mix for two sponges
   - In a large bowl put: 200 g plain flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280 g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt. Mix well. If there are lumps in the sugar, squeeze them through your fingers to break them up.

3. Make the wet mix and bake (repeat to make 4 sponges total)
   - Measure 200 ml buttermilk, 100 ml coffee, 150 ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla into a jug. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth.
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until well combined.
   - Pour the batter evenly into the two prepared tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
   - Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool completely.
   - Repeat the above steps so you have a total of 4 sponge cakes. (The sponges can be made up to three days ahead — wrap in cling film — or freeze for up to two months.)

4. Make the cookies-and-cream icing
   - Put the 250 g softened butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whip with a hand mixer until smooth.
   - Add the 280 g cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar. Mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer until smooth.
   - Put 10 filled chocolate biscuits into a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix until combined.

5. Make the cookie cake toppers
   - You’ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you’d like to write (for example a name or ‘WOW!’). Carefully insert a thin wooden skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit — some may break, so have extras.
   - Melt the 100 g white chocolate in the microwave (stirring every ~20 seconds) or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little melted chocolate over the surface of one side of each biscuit.
   - Roll out the ready-to-roll fondant to the thickness of a 50p coin. Cut out letters and stick these to the chocolate-covered side of each biscuit, then set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry and use an icing pen to write the name/word directly on the biscuit surface.

6. Assemble the cake
   - Stick one sponge to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing.
   - Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining sponges on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer.
   - Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the presentation as needed.

7. Finish and decorate
   - If you have leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and press them around the base of the cake.
   - Insert the dried cookie cake toppers (skewered biscuits with fondant letters) into the top of the cake.
   - Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days; bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before serving.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 60 minutes
Calories: 246 kcal

Ingredients
- 2 tsp fast-action dried yeast
- 500 g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 300 ml warm water (used with the yeast; included in method)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix the yeast with 300 ml warm water in a large bowl. Leave to sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is super bubbly, then tip in the flour, salt and olive oil. Bring the mixture together into a soft dough. Don’t worry if it looks a little rough round the edges.

2. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 5–10 minutes until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough. Try to knead using as little extra flour as possible, just enough so that the dough doesn’t stick – this will keep the pittas light and airy. Once kneaded, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to double in size, approximately 1 hour.

3. Heat the oven as high as it will go (ideally 250°C / 230°C fan / gas 9) and put a large baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven to get searingly hot. Divide the dough into eight balls then flatten each into a disc with the palm of your hand. On a lightly floured surface, roll each disc into an oval, around 20 cm long, 15 cm wide and 3–5 mm thick.

4. Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven. Dust with flour then place your pittas directly onto it – you may have to do this in batches. Return swiftly to the oven and bake for 4–5 minutes, or until the pittas have puffed up and are a pale golden colour. Wrap each hot pitta in a clean tea towel once it's baked to keep it soft while the others cook.

Ingredients
- 500g tomatoes (use a mixture of sizes and colours), cut into ½ cm pieces
- 50g gruyère (or vegetarian alternative), coarsely grated
- 1 garlic clove, finely grated
- 1 tbsp chopped oregano or thyme
- 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 100g cold butter, cut into cubes
- 2 eggs, plus extra beaten egg for brushing
- a good pinch of salt (plus 1 tsp for the tomatoes)
- black pepper

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 250 g plain (all-purpose) flour
- 1 tbsp milk, plus extra if needed
- 50 g white chocolate, chopped
- 50 g milk chocolate, chopped

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas mark 4. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.
2. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with the icing sugar using an electric whisk until the mixture is light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the plain flour and continue beating; the mixture will stiffen and look crumbly as the flour is incorporated.

5. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle and pipe swirled rings onto the prepared baking sheet. If the dough is too stiff to pipe, roll it into small balls and place them on the sheet instead. Leave space between each cookie to allow for slight spreading.
6. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly golden around the edges. Remove from the oven and transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
7. Meanwhile, place the white chocolate and the milk chocolate in separate microwave-safe bowls. Melt each chocolate in 20-second bursts, stirring between bursts, until smooth.
8. Once the cookies are fully cooled, dip one end of each cookie into the milk chocolate and the other end into the white chocolate (or dip half of each cookie in one chocolate and the other half in the other). Let any excess drip off, then return the cookies to the wire rack to allow the chocolate to set.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 175g raspberry jam
- 50g desiccated coconut, lightly toasted
- 12 maraschino cherries
- 200g plain flour
- 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 65g icing sugar
- 1 large egg yolk
- 800ml whole milk
- 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 5 large egg yolks
- 100g caster sugar
- 50g custard powder

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the pastry: put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the icing sugar and a pinch of salt, then add the 1 large egg yolk and bring the mixture together into a dough. If the pastry is too dry to come together, add 1–2 tbsp cold water. Tip onto a work surface and form into a rough ball; knead briefly.

2. Roll and chill the pastry: roll the pastry out between two sheets of baking parchment into a roughly 28cm circle. Chill for 20–30 minutes until firm, then use it to line a 23cm tart tin. Push the pastry into the corners, then trim the edge so there’s 1–2cm pastry overhanging the rim (patch any small breaks with off-cuts).

Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 10–15 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, then trim the excess pastry using a small serrated knife.

4. Make the custard: bring the milk and vanilla to the boil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. In a medium bowl, beat together the 5 egg yolks, 100g caster sugar and 50g custard powder until well combined.

5. Combine and thicken: slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg mixture, whisking continuously until smooth and well combined. Tip the custard mixture back into the pan and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring continuously, for 2–3 minutes until very thick. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.

6. Assemble the tart: spread the raspberry jam over the base of the cooled pastry case. Carefully pour over the custard and smooth with the back of a spoon or spatula.

7. Finish and chill: sprinkle the lightly toasted desiccated coconut over the custard and dot the maraschino cherries around the edge in a circle. Chill for 2–3 hours, or until the custard is set, before serving.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a complete Manchester tart recipe with difficulty and total time, directly addressing the notion of a quick, easy dessert for guests.

  - 75 ml double cream

- For decoration
  - 37 g pack Maltesers
  - Honeycomb shards (from above)

Step-by-step instructions

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4.
   - Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment.

2. Make the malt sponges
   - Put the 200 g butter and 250 g caster sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy.
   - Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well between each addition.
   - Tip in the 225 g plain flour, 25 g powdered malt drink and 2 tsp baking powder (with 1/4 tsp salt if you like), fold together.
   - Add the 100 g natural yogurt and 2 tsp vanilla extract, give everything a final stir.
   - Divide the mixture between the 2 prepared tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25–30 minutes or until a skewer pushed into the centre comes out clean.
   - Cool for 10 minutes in the tins, then remove, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

3. Make the chocolate sponges
   - Grease and line the tins as before.
   - In the same bowl (no need to wash), cream the 175 g butter and 250 g sugar until pale and fluffy, then add the eggs one at a time, mixing until combined.
   - Sift in the 225 g plain flour, 25 g cocoa powder and 2 tsp baking powder (with 1/4 tsp salt if you like). Fold to combine.
   - Add the 50 g natural yogurt, the melted 100 g dark chocolate and 100 ml boiling water. Stir until combined.
   - Divide between the tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, testing with a skewer as before.
   - Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, turn out, remove the parchment and cool completely.
   - Note: The sponges can be made up to 2 days ahead; wrap cooled sponges tightly in cling film.

4. Make the honeycomb
   - Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil.
   - Put 200 g sugar and 5 tbsp golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel — do not stir.
   - When the caramel colour is to your liking, add the 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup.
   - Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the prepared tray and set aside for about 30 minutes to cool and firm up.
   - When cooled, break into tall shards for decoration.

5. Make the cream-cheese buttercream
   - In your largest mixing bowl, beat the 250 g softened butter with half of the 750 g icing sugar, the 3 tbsp powdered malt drink and 1 tsp vanilla until smooth.
   - Add the remaining icing sugar and the 280 g cream cheese, and beat again until well combined. (Take care not to overmix or the icing may become runny.)

6. Assemble the cake (stacking and crumb coat)
   - Put one sponge on a cake stand or board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing.
   - Use about 1/4 of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges (e.g., malt, chocolate, malt, chocolate — depending on how many layers you have).
   - Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up.
   - Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling gaps between sponges — this is the crumb coat.
   - Chill the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up the crumb coat.

7. Finish icing
   - Once chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. Pile icing on top, then ease it over the edge and down the sides with a palette knife; smooth or texture as you prefer.
   - Chill the iced cake for another 30 minutes.

8. Make the ganache drip
   - Put the 100 g finely chopped dark chocolate in a bowl.
   - Heat the 75 ml double cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5–10 minutes.
   - Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up slightly — you want it pourable but not too runny for drip control.

9. Apply the drip and decorate
   - When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge.
   - Spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drip down the sides with your spoon (start at the back to practice).
   - Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with ganache as well.
   - Break the honeycomb into shards and stack them on top of the cake.
   - Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base and some honeycomb crumbs.

10. Serve and store
   - The cake is best served within 2–3 hours of assembling but will still be tasty for up to 3 days.
   - Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving.

c0da76b2-458a-43e6-949e-614241aea05f,Easy cheese & onion bread recipe using malted grain brown or wholemeal flour — ready in about 50 minutes?,"Recipe: Cheese & onion bread
Difficulty: Easy
Total time: 50 minutes
Calories: 183 kcal

Ingredients
- 400g malted grain brown bread flour, or wholemeal or granary bread flour
- 100g strong white bread flour
- 7g sachet easy-bake dried yeast (or 2 tsp quick dried yeast)
- 1½ tsp salt
- 1 tbsp soft butter
- 1 large onion, cut into thin wedges
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 beaten egg
- 50g grated mature cheddar

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix flours, yeast and salt
   - In a large mixing bowl, mix the malted brown (or wholemeal/granary) flour with the strong white flour, the dried yeast and the salt.
   - Add the soft butter and rub it into the flour with your fingertips.

2. Add water and form dough
   - Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand-warm (cool rather than hot) water.
   - Using a round-bladed knife, mix in enough of the remaining water (and a little more if needed) until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough.
   - Gather it into a ball with your hands.

3. Knead and first rise
   - Put the dough onto a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding only the minimum extra flour if necessary.
   - Place the dough ball on the work surface, cover with an upturned clean large glass bowl, and leave for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size and light and springy (timing depends on room warmth).

4. Knock back and rest
   - Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3–4 times to remove large air bubbles. Shape into a ball.
   - Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 minutes.

5. Cook the onion
   - Fry the onion wedges in the olive oil until very lightly caramelised, then leave to cool.

6. Divide and shape
   - Cut the dough in half and shape each piece into a ball.
   - Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 minutes.
   - Flatten each ball into an 18cm round and place each on a large baking tray lined with baking parchment.
   - Make 6 deepish cuts in each round to mark them into 6 wedges.
   - Cover with a clean tea towel and leave for 40–45 minutes, or until doubled in size.

7. Finish and top
   - Preheat the oven as below while the dough is proving.
   - Brush the risen rounds with the beaten egg.
   - Scatter the cooled caramelised onion over the tops, then sprinkle with the grated mature cheddar.

8. Bake with steam for a crisp crust
   - Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 minutes before baking and heat the oven to 230°C / 210°C fan / gas 8.
   - When ready to bake, put the risen bread in the oven and carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the hot roasting tin (this will hiss and create steam). Immediately lower the oven temperature to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7.
   - Bake for 30–35 minutes or until golden. If the onion is getting too brown, lay a piece of parchment over the top.

9. Cool and check
   - Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
   - To check it’s done, tap the underside of the loaf — it should be firm and sound hollow.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 55 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 50 g butter
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 celery sticks, chopped
- 50 g plain (all-purpose) flour
- 600 ml milk
- 90 g pack pulled ham hock
- Small pack tarragon, leaves only, chopped
- 1 egg, beaten
- 320 g pack ready-rolled puff pastry
- Cooked peas, to serve
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan)/gas 6.

2. In a shallow casserole or ovenproof dish, melt the butter over medium heat on the hob.

3. Add the chopped onion and celery and fry gently until softened (do not brown), about 5–8 minutes.

4. Sprinkle in the plain flour and stir to coat the softened vegetables. Cook for 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste.

5. Slowly add the milk in small splashes, stirring very well after each addition to avoid lumps. Once all the milk is incorporated, bring the mixture to a gentle simmer so it thickens into a smooth sauce.

6. Fold in the pulled ham hock and the chopped tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in about half of the beaten egg to enrich the filling and help it set a little.

7. Prepare the pastry: cut a circle of puff pastry about 2 cm wider than the top of your dish.

8. Drape the pastry over the dish, tucking and folding the edges to seal the filling inside and form a crust. Use any off-cuts of pastry to cut rough strips or shapes to decorate the top if you like.

9. Brush the exposed pastry with the remaining beaten egg to give a glossy, golden finish.

10. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and crisp and the filling is bubbling.

11. While the pie bakes, cook or reheat your peas (steamed or gently boiled) to serve alongside.

12. Remove the pie from the oven, let it rest for a couple of minutes, then serve slices with the cooked peas.

Notes

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 95 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 150 ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 200 g plain flour
- 8 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 280 g light brown soft sugar
- 200 ml buttermilk
- 100 ml strong coffee or espresso
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2½ × 114 g packs milk chocolate fingers
- 8 tubes of sugar‑coated chocolates (or other sweets)
- 100 g milk chocolate, chopped into small pieces, plus 50 g/2 oz for decorating
- 200 g slightly salted butter, softened
- 400 g icing sugar, sieved
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 bendy straw
- 2 wooden skewers
- 1 paper bag or sweet packet (see tip)
- Sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / Gas 4.
   - Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment. If your tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. Mix dry ingredients
   - In a bowl, combine the plain flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, light brown sugar and 1 tsp salt. Break up any lumps in the sugar by squeezing them between your fingers.

3. Mix wet ingredients
   - In a jug, measure the buttermilk, coffee, vegetable oil and vanilla. Add the eggs and whisk until smooth.

4. Combine batter and bake
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined.
   - Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
   - Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool completely.
   - (These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can freeze them for up to two months.)

5. Make the chocolate fudge icing
   - Put 100 g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water and stir until melted. (Alternatively melt in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds.)
   - Remove from heat and leave to cool slightly.
   - In another large bowl, mash the 200 g softened butter and 400 g sieved icing sugar with a spatula to combine, then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth (mashing first prevents icing sugar mess).
   - Sift in 4 tbsp cocoa powder, pour in the melted chocolate and add 2 tbsp milk, then mix until smooth.

6. Ice the cake
   - Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the two cakes together on a cake stand or board.
   - Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing — don’t worry about being too neat.

7. Attach chocolate fingers
   - Straight after icing (while the icing is still soft), press the milk chocolate fingers around the sides of the cake so they stick. The icing will firm up and help hold them in place.

8. Prepare extra chocolate for sticking sweets
   - Melt the remaining 50 g chocolate in the microwave or over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave it to cool until it reaches a spreadable consistency. If it firms up too much, reheat briefly and stir.

9. Build the gravity-defying sweet tower
   - Push one wooden skewer into the centre of the cake. Slip the bendy straw over the skewer — this gives stability. Push 1–2 cm of the straw into the cake.
   - Using a cutlery knife or small palette knife, spread a blob of the melted 50 g chocolate onto a sugar‑coated tube sweet. Starting at the base, stick the sweets to the straw.
   - Work in stages, allowing the chocolate to set a little between layers, and continue building sweets up the straw until it’s completely covered. Stop when you reach the bend in the straw.
   - If the chocolate becomes too firm while you work, warm it briefly until spreadable again.

10. Finish the top
   - Stick the remaining wooden skewer into the top of the straw so it pokes out at an angle. Place the paper bag or sweet packet over the top (you may need a little sticky tape to hold it in place).
   - If any of the straw is still visible, cover it with more sweets.
   - Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface.

Storage tip:
- Will keep well stored in an airtight tin for 2 days.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 8 small firm pears (we used Conference)
- 200g golden caster sugar
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise
- 6 cloves
- 1 lemon, zest pared
- 1 orange, zest pared
- Vegan ice cream, to serve (optional)
- 250g pitted dates
- 2 tbsp linseeds
- 300ml unsweetened almond milk
- 200ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 175g dark muscovado sugar
- 200g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tsp ground mixed spice
- 1/2 tsp salt (for the sponge; included in the method as needed)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Poach the pears and make the syrup:
   - Peel the pears and cut the bottom off each to give a flat base so they will stand upright in the tin. Trim them to a height that will fit snugly in your tin. Use a melon baller or a small knife to scoop out the pips from the base. Roughly chop the pear scraps (discard the pips) and set the scraps aside for the sponge.
   - Tip 200g golden caster sugar, the 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 star anise, 6 cloves, lemon and orange zests and 600ml water into a saucepan large enough to fit all the pears. Bring to the boil, then simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
   - Add the pears, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for 15 minutes, until a knife easily slides into a pear. Leave the pears to cool in the poaching liquid.

2. Make the date mixture for the sponge:
   - Put the 250g pitted dates and 2 tbsp linseeds in a saucepan and add the 300ml unsweetened almond milk. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 2–3 minutes until the dates are soft.
   - Pour the mixture into a food processor and blitz until smooth. Add 200ml vegetable oil and blend again until combined. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside to cool slightly.

3. Prepare the cake batter:
   - Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4. Grease and line a 20 x 30 cm baking tin (a loose-bottomed tin if possible) with a strip of baking parchment.
   - Put the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl: 175g dark muscovado sugar, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp ground mixed spice, and 1/2 tsp salt. Mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers and shaking the bowl a few times to lift any remaining lumps.
   - Add the cooled date and oil mixture and stir well to combine. Fold in the chopped pear scraps you set aside earlier.

4. Assemble and bake:
   - Scrape the cake mixture into the prepared tin and level it. Nestle the poached pears into the batter, standing them straight up so their bottom halves are covered by the batter.
   - Bake for 35–40 minutes until the cake is cooked through. Insert a skewer into the centre — it should come out clean. If there is wet cake mixture on the skewer, return to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, then check again.

5. Finish with the syrup and serve:
   - Meanwhile, bring the pear poaching liquid back to the boil and simmer until reduced to a glossy syrup.
   - When the pudding is cooked, cool for 5–10 minutes, then brush the entire surface with the reduced syrup, saving a little extra to serve alongside.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 80 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 450g strong white bread flour, plus a little for dusting
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 1 tsp golden caster sugar
- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle
- 150g tub fresh pesto
- 240g tub semi-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
- 100g grated mozzarella (ready-grated is best for this, as it is drier than fresh)
- 50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated
- Handful basil leaves
- 1½ tsp fine salt
- ~300ml warm water (measure out 300ml and use roughly 280ml first; reserve a little in case you need it)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix the dry ingredients:
   - Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1½ tsp fine salt in a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of a tabletop mixer.

2. Make the dough:
   - Measure out 300ml warm water and add roughly 280ml to the flour along with the 2 tbsp olive oil. Start mixing until the ingredients start to clump together into a dough. If the dough seems a little dry, add the remaining water.
   - Once combined, knead for 10 minutes by hand on your work surface, or for 5 minutes on a medium speed in a mixer. The dough is ready when it feels soft, springy and elastic.

3. First prove:
   - Clean the bowl, drizzle in a little oil, then pop the dough back in, turning it over so the sides of the bowl are coated in oil. Cover with some oiled cling film and set aside in a warm place to double in size – this will take 1–3 hours, depending on the temperature.

4. Shape the whirls:
   - Line a baking tray with baking parchment.
   - Uncover the dough and punch it down a couple of times with your fist to knock out the air bubbles. Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and dust the top with a little flour if it is sticky.
   - Roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 40 x 30 cm.
   - Spread the fresh pesto evenly over the dough, then scatter the chopped semi-dried tomatoes, both cheeses (mozzarella and parmesan) and the basil leaves over the top.
   - Roll the dough up from one of the longer sides into a long sausage.

5. Cut and prove:
   - Use a sharp knife to cut the rolled dough into 12 even pieces.
   - Place the pieces on the prepared baking tray, cut-side up, in a 3-by-4 formation. Make sure the open end of each roll is tucked in towards the centre of the swirl to prevent them from uncoiling during baking.
   - Leave a little space between each roll for expansion. Loosely cover with oiled cling film and leave to prove for 30 minutes–1 hour until almost doubled in size again. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200°C / 180°C fan / gas 6.

6. Bake:
   - Uncover the rolls once puffed up. Bake on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 35–40 minutes, until golden brown and the centre looks dry and not doughy.

7. Cool and serve:
   - Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.

- The recipe uses fresh pesto, basil and semi-dried tomatoes as requested.
- The difficulty is listed as ""More effort"" because of kneading and proving times.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 25 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 500g strawberries, hulled and halved (quarter any larger ones)
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 100g caster sugar
- 150ml mascarpone
- 300ml double cream
- 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste
- 4 gingernut biscuits, crushed
- Small handful of pistachios, roughly chopped (optional)
- Freeze-dried strawberries, crushed (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Put the strawberries, lemon juice, sugar and 2 tbsp water in a large pan over a medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes until the fruit has softened. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and leave to cool slightly.

2. Reserve some of the cooked strawberry mixture: tip about 300g of it into a blender (keep the rest for topping later). Blitz the 300g until smooth, then pass the purée through a sieve into a jug to remove seeds and pulp.

3. In a large bowl, whisk the mascarpone to soften it. Add the double cream, vanilla bean paste and lemon zest, then whisk again until the mixture is just starting to thicken.

4. Fold the sieved strawberry purée into the mascarpone and cream mixture until combined. If you prefer, you can swirl rather than fully fold to create layers of compote through the mousse.

5. Spoon or pipe the mousse into glass tumblers or serving dishes. Top each with some of the reserved strawberry compote you set aside earlier.

6. Sprinkle over the crushed gingernut biscuits and, if using, scatter chopped pistachios and crushed freeze-dried strawberries for extra texture and color.

- 200g dark chocolate, roughly chopped
- 3 eggs
- 200g caster sugar
- 100g plain flour
- 40g cocoa powder
- ½ tbsp sea salt flakes
- 1 tsp cardamom pods, seeds crushed
- ¼ tsp allspice
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- ½ tsp ground ginger

Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories: 170 kcal

Ingredients
- 200 g rye flour, plus extra for dusting
- 200 g strong white or wholemeal flour
- 7 g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- ½ tsp fine salt
- 1 tbsp honey
- 250 ml warm water (more if needed)
- 1 tsp caraway seed (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Tip the rye and white/wholemeal flours, the yeast and the salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine.
2. In a jug, mix the honey into about 250 ml warm water. Pour the liquid into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix to form a dough.
   - Note: rye flour absorbs a lot of water and can feel quite dry. If the dough looks too dry, add a little more warm water, a tablespoon at a time, until you have a soft dough.
3. Tip the dough onto your work surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth. Because rye contains less gluten than white flour, the dough won’t feel as springy as a conventional white loaf.
4. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for 1–2 hours, or until roughly doubled in size.
5. Dust a 2 lb / 900 g loaf tin with flour.
6. Tip the risen dough back onto your work surface and knead briefly to knock out any large air bubbles. If using caraway seeds, work them into the dough now.

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 80 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 375g salted butter, softened, plus extra for the tin
- 375g golden caster sugar
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 375g self-raising flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- 150ml milk
- Blue food colouring
- Pink food colouring
- Sprinkles, to decorate

For the buttercream:
- 250g salted butter, softened
- 400g icing sugar, sifted
- Seeds from 1 vanilla pod (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)
- 100g full-fat cream cheese

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4. Butter and line three 20cm loose-bottomed sandwich cake tins with baking parchment.

2. Make the sponge batter: Beat the 375g softened butter and 375g golden caster sugar together in a stand mixer or with an electric whisk for 5–8 minutes, until light and fluffy.

3. Add the eggs: Whisk in the 6 eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

4. Fold in dry ingredients and milk: Gently fold in the 375g self-raising flour and 1½ tsp baking powder, and add the 150ml milk to loosen the batter to a soft dropping consistency.

5. Divide and colour the batter: Divide the mixture between three bowls (weigh for accuracy if you like). Colour one bowl of batter blue and another pink — start with a little colouring and add more until you reach the desired depth. Leave the third bowl uncoloured (plain).

6. Create the zebra/rainbow effect in the tins: Have the three prepared cake tins ready. For each tin, spoon a heaped tablespoon of batter into the centre — blue batter into one tin, pink into the second, and plain into the third. Working quickly, keep alternating dollops of different coloured batter on top of each previous dollop. Don’t wait for the batter to settle; the weight of the layers will spread them. Gently tap and shake the tins to even out the mixture.

7. Bake: Bake the cakes in the centre of the oven for 25–30 minutes, or until the cakes are firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

8. Cool: Turn the cakes out top-side down onto wire racks straightaway, then leave to cool completely.

9. Make the buttercream: Put 250g softened butter, 400g sifted icing sugar and the vanilla pod seeds into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or use a bowl and electric whisk). Beat for about 5 minutes until fluffy and aerated. Add 100g full-fat cream cheese and beat briefly until just combined — do not overbeat.

10. Assemble the cake: Place one cooled cake on a cake stand or serving plate and spread about 2 tablespoons of the buttercream on top. Repeat with the second cake, then place the third on top.

11. Finish the icing: Spread a smooth layer of the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake using a large palette knife. For a casual “naked” finish, leave some slightly less-iced spots if you like.

Total cooking time: 180 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 200 ml soya milk
- 1 lemon, zested and ½ juiced
- 500 g marzipan
- Icing sugar, for dusting
- 250 g dairy-free spread, plus extra for the tin
- 250 g mixed dried fruit (we used sultanas, raisins and candied peel)
- 75 g glacé cherries, roughly chopped
- 1 orange, zested and juiced
- 200 g light brown soft sugar
- 200 g plain flour
- 75 g ground almonds
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp ground ginger
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 25 g apricot jam, warmed, plus extra for sticking the marzipan balls to the cake

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/gas 4.
2. Mix the soya milk with the ½ lemon juice in a jug and set aside for a few minutes to thicken.
3. Cut 150 g of the marzipan from the larger block. Lightly dust a work surface with icing sugar and roll the 150 g marzipan out until it is just slightly smaller than the base of a 23 cm cake tin. Set aside.
4. Using the dairy-free spread, butter a 23 cm springform cake tin and line with a double layer of baking parchment.
5. In a large bowl, mix the mixed dried fruit, lemon zest, chopped glacé cherries, and orange zest and juice together, tossing a few times until well combined.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the dairy-free spread with the light brown soft sugar until pale using an electric whisk.
7. Add the plain flour, ground almonds, baking powder, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, mixed spice, and vanilla bean paste to the creamed mixture and mix briefly.
8. Tip in the milk mixture and whisk until you have a smooth batter.
9. Fold the fruit mixture (including any juice in the bowl) and a pinch of salt into the batter until well combined — don’t worry if the batter looks slightly curdled.

11. Spoon over the remaining batter to cover the marzipan, smooth the surface, and level.
12. Bake at 180°C for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 150°C (130°C fan)/gas 2 and bake for a further 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean and the cake is well risen and firm.
13. Carefully remove the cake from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.
14. Brush the cooled cake with the warmed 25 g apricot jam.
15. Cut a 200 g piece from the remaining marzipan and roll it out on a surface dusted with icing sugar. Cut out a 23 cm circle using the base of the cake tin as a guide. Use the rolling pin to lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface (the apricot jam will help it stick).
16. Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little extra warmed apricot jam to stick the balls around the edge of the cake — these represent the 12 apostles (minus Judas).
17. If desired, use a kitchen blowtorch briefly and carefully to slightly burnish the marzipan decorations until just golden (take care not to burn).

1. Heat the oven to 140°C (120°C fan)/gas 1. Arrange the halved tomatoes, cut-sides up, over a baking sheet. Brush them lightly with the olive oil and put a little torn basil on top of each tomato half. Roast the tomatoes gently for 1½ hours until they are semi-dried. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 190°C (170°C fan)/gas 5.

2. Make the pastry: tip the flour into a food processor with the butter and whizz until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the 50g grated gruyère and 2–3 tbsp cold water and pulse until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and briefly knead.

3. Roll out the pastry and line a 25cm flan tin (there’s no need to trim off the excess at this stage). Line the pastry with greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15 minutes, then remove the paper and baking beans and continue cooking until the pastry is crisp and light golden. Using a small, sharp knife, carefully trim off any excess pastry.

4. Spread the pesto over the base of the baked pastry case.

5. Lightly whisk the 2 eggs, then whisk in the single cream and milk. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the 100g grated gruyère.

6. Pour the egg and cheese mixture into the pastry case. Arrange the slow-roasted tomatoes over the top, cut-sides up. Scatter the handful of black olives over the tart.

7. Bake the tart at 190°C (170°C fan)/gas 5 for 25–30 minutes until puffed and golden.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 95 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 500g pack sweet shortcrust pastry
- 3 tbsp cocoa, plus extra for rolling and dusting
- 2 tsp clear honey
- ½ tsp good-quality sea salt
- Honeycomb, crumbled, to serve (optional)
- Crème fraîche or single cream, to serve
- 140g set honey
- 140g butter, diced
- 150ml double cream
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 400g dark chocolate, broken into chunks
- 300ml double cream

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the chocolate pastry: Dice the pastry into chunks and put in a food processor. Sift over the 3 tbsp cocoa, drizzle over the 2 tsp clear honey, then pulse to combine into a chocolate pastry. (If you don’t have a food processor, rub the ingredients together until they form a dough.) Roll out the dough on a lightly cocoa-dusted work surface to a size large enough to line a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin with a little overhang. Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

2. Blind-bake the tart case: Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Scrunch up a big sheet of baking parchment and use it to line the tart tin. Fill with baking beans and bake for 15–20 minutes until sandy and the sides are firm. Remove the beans and paper, then bake for a further 5–15 minutes until the base is really biscuity. Trim off the overhang and cool the tart case.

3. Make the salted honey fudge layer: Put the 140g set honey, 140g butter (diced) and 150ml double cream into a small pan and warm gently until the butter has completely melted. Bring to a gentle simmer and bubble, stirring, for 4–5 minutes until more golden-coloured and thickened.

5. Assemble the tart: Pour the melted chocolate mixture gently over the set honey fudge layer in the tart case, covering it evenly. Chill the tart until fully set and ready to serve.

6. Serve: Remove the tart from the fridge about 10 minutes before serving to soften slightly. Dust lightly with cocoa and scatter with crumbled honeycomb, if using. Serve with dollops of crème fraîche or a jug of single cream.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 125 minutes
Calories (kcal): None provided

Ingredients
- 340g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for the tins
- 340g caster sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 340g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 tbsp milk
- 400g caramel or lemon curd (your choice)
- For the Swiss meringue buttercream:
  - 5 egg whites
  - 375g caster sugar
  - 500g unsalted butter, cubed and softened
  - 3 tsp vanilla extract
- Food colouring gels (for Pride-style colours the recipe suggests: red, orange, yellow, green, dark blue, purple, light pink, baby blue, brown and black)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prepare the tins and oven
   - Butter three 20cm round cake tins and line their bases with baking parchment.
   - Heat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan) / Gas 5.

2. Make the sponge batter
   - Beat 340g softened unsalted butter and 340g caster sugar together in a large bowl until light and smooth.
   - Gradually beat in the 6 large eggs until combined, then mix in 1 tsp vanilla extract.
   - Fold in 340g self-raising flour and 1 tsp baking powder until fully combined.
   - Stir in 2 tbsp milk to loosen the batter.

3. Bake the sponges
   - Divide the mixture between the three prepared tins.
   - Bake the sponges for about 20 minutes, until golden and a skewer inserted into each centre comes out clean.
   - Leave to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

4. Make the Swiss meringue buttercream
   - Put 5 egg whites and 375g caster sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a small pan of gently simmering water (ensure the bowl does not touch the water).
   - Whisk for about 3–4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is warm.
   - Remove from the heat and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use an electric whisk). Whisk on medium-high speed for about 10 minutes until you have a thick, glossy meringue.
   - Gradually whisk in the softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully incorporated and the buttercream is fluffy.
   - Whisk in 3 tsp vanilla extract.

5. Assemble the cake (first fill and crumb coat)
   - Place one sponge on a plate or cake stand. Top it with 3–4 tbsp of the buttercream and spread, making it slightly thicker at the edge.
   - Spoon half of the caramel or lemon curd over the buttercream on the middle part of the cake — do not spread it to the edges.
   - Add the second sponge and repeat with buttercream and the remaining caramel/curd.
   - Top with the final sponge.
   - Smooth a thin layer of buttercream around the outside of the cake to form a crumb coat.
   - Chill the cake in the fridge for at least 45 minutes.

6. Final smooth coat and chill
   - After chilling, smooth another layer of buttercream around the cake using a palette knife to fully cover the sponge. Reserve about half of the buttercream for decoration.
   - Return the cake and the reserved buttercream to the fridge for another 45 minutes to 1 hour to firm up.

7. Colour the buttercream and decorate
   - Divide the remaining buttercream between 11 small bowls. Mix a different gel colouring into 10 of them, leaving the 11th bowl white.
   - Put each colour into a separate piping bag (or cut a ~1cm hole in the end of each bag or fit a round nozzle).
   - Pipe one row of buttercream blobs in alternating colours from top to bottom around the cake. Use a teaspoon or small palette knife to very lightly smear each blob of frosting away from you.
   - For the second row, choose the colour next in sequence to the adjacent colour and pipe over the thinnest part of the smeared blob. Continue piping around, following this pattern to create a swirl effect of colours around the sides.
   - Repeat the same piping-and-smear technique on top of the cake, this time smearing the icing in towards the middle until the top is covered.

8. Serve and store
   - Once decorated, the cake is ready to slice and serve.
   - Store in an airtight container for up to three days.

Notes
- The recipe uses a Swiss meringue buttercream which requires working with warm egg whites over simmering water and a good whisking time—plan your timing accordingly.
- If you prefer fewer colours, adjust the number of bowls and piping bags as desired; the instructions use 10 coloured bags plus one white for a vivid multi-colour finish.",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Provides a rainbow layer cake recipe, which matches the 'rainbow layer cake' concept, but is labeled 'More effort' and shows a total time of 125 minutes (not around 105 minutes) and not in the Easy category, so it does not fully satisfy the user's criteria."

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 8 small firm pears (we used Conference)
- 200g golden caster sugar
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise
- 6 cloves
- Zest of 1 lemon, pared
- Zest of 1 orange, pared
- Vegan ice cream, to serve (optional)
- 250g pitted dates
- 2 tbsp linseeds
- 300ml unsweetened almond milk
- 200ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 175g dark muscovado sugar
- 200g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tsp ground mixed spice
- 1/2 tsp salt

Step-by-step instructions

1. Prepare the pears
- Peel the pears and cut the bottom off each so they have a flat base and will stand upright in your tin. Trim them to a height that will fit snugly in your baking tin.
- Use a melon baller or small knife to remove the pips from the base of each pear. Roughly chop the pear scraps (discard the pips) and set the chopped scraps aside for the sponge.

2. Poach the pears
- Tip 200g golden caster sugar, the 2 cinnamon sticks, star anise, 6 cloves, the lemon and orange zests and 600ml water into a saucepan large enough to hold all the pears.
- Bring to the boil, then simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
- Add the pears, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for about 15 minutes, until a knife easily slides into a pear.
- Remove the pears and leave them to cool in the poaching liquid.

3. Make the date mixture for the sponge
- Put 250g pitted dates and 2 tbsp linseeds in a saucepan and add 300ml unsweetened almond milk.
- Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2–3 minutes until the dates are soft.
- Pour the date mixture into a food processor and blitz until smooth. Add 200ml vegetable oil and blend again until combined.
- Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside to cool slightly.

4. Prepare oven and tin
- Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.
- Grease and line a 20 x 30cm baking tin (a loose-bottomed one if possible) with a strip of baking parchment.

5. Make the sponge batter
- In a large mixing bowl combine 175g dark muscovado sugar, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp ground mixed spice and 1/2 tsp salt. Mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers.
- Add the cooled date-and-oil mixture to the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.
- Fold in the chopped pear scraps you set aside earlier.

6. Assemble and bake
- Scrape the cake mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface.
- Nestle the whole poached pears into the sponge mixture, standing them upright so the bottom halves are covered by the batter.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes until the cake is cooked through. Insert a skewer into the centre of the sponge — it should come out clean. If the skewer has wet batter, bake for another 10 minutes and check again.

7. Make the toffee-ish glaze and finish
- Meanwhile, return the pear poaching liquid to the boil and simmer until reduced to a glossy syrup.
- When the pudding is cooked, allow it to cool in the tin for 5–10 minutes, then brush the entire surface (and exposed pears) with the reduced poaching syrup. Reserve a little extra syrup to serve alongside.

8. Serve
- Serve warm, brushed with extra syrup and with vegan ice cream if desired.

- 100g flaked toasted almonds

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 140°C (120°C fan)/gas mark 1. Cut 3 pieces of baking parchment to fit 3 baking sheets for the meringues. If you don’t have 3 sheets you can cook in batches — divide the meringue mixture into 3 and cook separately.

2. Using a plate or the base of a 20cm cake tin, draw a 20cm circle on each piece of parchment, then flip the parchment so the pencil side is facing down. Put 3 oven racks in your oven — if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this can sit in the bottom of the oven.

3. Put the 6 egg whites in a large bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk until thick and holding soft peaks.

4. Start adding the 300g white caster sugar, 1–2 tablespoons at a time, whisking continuously. When all the sugar has been incorporated the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks.

5. Add the ¾ tsp white wine vinegar and whisk briefly to combine.

6. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it toward the outlines to make thin circles.

7. Scatter the 100g flaked toasted almonds over the meringues, saving a few to serve on top once assembled.

8. Bake the meringues for 1 hour, then leave to cool in the oven. When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hours, or assemble straight away.

9. Meanwhile, toss the strawberries and cherries with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10–15 minutes.

10. Pour the 600ml double cream, 50ml amaretto, ½ tsp almond extract and the remaining 50g icing sugar into a large bowl and whisk until softly whipped.

11. To assemble: use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over one third of the cream, then scatter with some of the macerated strawberries and cherries. Repeat with the second meringue layer and more cream and fruit.

12. Top with the final meringue, finish with the remaining cream and fruit, and arrange the reserved whole strawberries and cherries on top. Scatter over the remaining flaked toasted almonds.

13. Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 day.",RELEVANT,"[The answer provides a complete recipe for an amaretto meringue cake that uses 400g strawberries, 400g cherries, and 100g flaked toasted almonds, with steps and assembly instructions—directly addressing the question about making a showstopper meringue cake for entertaining.]"

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 215ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin
- 300ml soy milk, almond or coconut milk
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 335g light muscovado sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
- 175g soy yogurt or coconut yogurt
- 300g self-raising flour
- 105g cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 100g dark dairy-free chocolate
- 140g vegan spread, at room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract
- 265g icing sugar, sifted
- ½–1 tbsp plant milk (whatever you used in the sponge)
- Colourful sprinkles (make sure they're suitable for vegans), to decorate (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Oil a 23 x 33cm baking tin (at least 4cm deep) and line the base and sides with baking parchment.

2. Whisk the 300ml plant milk and 2 tsp apple cider vinegar together in a jug – the milk should curdle slightly. Set aside.

3. In a bowl, whisk together 335g light muscovado sugar, 215ml sunflower oil and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Whisk in the 175g soy or coconut yogurt, making sure to break down any sugar lumps. Pour in the soured milk mixture and mix well.

4. Sift 300g self-raising flour, 105g cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into a separate bowl. Stir to combine.

5. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until you have a smooth batter. Be careful not to over-mix.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 30–35 minutes, until well risen and springy and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out almost clean. A few sticky crumbs are fine, but the mixture should not be wet.

7. Leave the cake to cool in its tin for 20 minutes, then carefully turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Be gentle—the sponge will be delicate. The sponge will keep, covered, at room temperature for up to two days.

8. While the cake cools, make the vegan buttercream. Melt 100g dark dairy-free chocolate in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool.

9. Beat 140g vegan spread and 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract on high speed in a stand mixer (or with a hand mixer) for a few minutes until pale and fluffy.

10. Add 265g sifted icing sugar gradually, starting on a low speed and then increasing to high until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled melted chocolate and combine thoroughly. If the icing is very stiff, add ½–1 tbsp plant milk (the same milk used in the sponge) to loosen it. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 minutes before using.

11. When the cake is completely cool, spread the buttercream over the top and decorate with vegan sprinkles if desired.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 95 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not specified

Ingredients
- 500g fresh spinach
- 3 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 6 spring onions, ends trimmed, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- Generous pinch of ground nutmeg
- 200g ricotta
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tbsp chopped dill, plus 1 rounded tsp
- 2 tbsp snipped chives
- 2 tsp chopped mint
- 5 sheets filo pastry (each about 46 x 25cm — about 250g total weight)
- 100g feta
- Minted yogurt dip (see tip), to serve (optional)
- Tomato, cucumber & pepper salad (see tip), to serve (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat and prepare spinach: Pack the spinach into a large heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over it and press the spinach down with a wooden spoon so leaves are submerged. Leave for 1 minute to wilt, stirring a couple of times. Tip the spinach into a large colander and run under cold water to cool quickly.

2. Drain and dry the spinach: Drain well, pressing the spinach down with the wooden spoon, then squeeze out excess water with your hands. Pat the spinach dry with kitchen paper into a compact shape, lay it on a board and roughly chop. Set aside.

3. Cook the aromatics: Heat 2 tsp of the rapeseed oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the shallot, spring onions and garlic and fry over a fairly high heat for 3–4 minutes, stirring often, until softened and just starting to brown.

4. Finish the spinach: Lower the heat, add the chopped spinach and stir for 1 minute only to finish drying. Season with black pepper and a good pinch of nutmeg. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.

5. Make the ricotta mixture: In a bowl, stir the ricotta into the beaten egg. Mix in 2 tbsp chopped dill, the snipped chives and the chopped mint. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt (use sparingly for a reduced-salt version).

6. Prepare the tin and filo: Lightly oil a 20cm square x 4cm deep cake tin. Mix the remaining rapeseed oil with the 1 rounded tsp chopped dill. Lay the filo sheets on a large board and keep them covered with a clean, slightly damp tea towel to prevent drying.

7. Line the tin with filo: Brush the top filo sheet with a little of the dill oil, then lower it into the tin to line the base and two sides with an overhang. Brush a bit more oil over the second sheet and lay it in the tin the other way round so it drapes over and lines the base and the other two sides. Repeat the criss-cross layering with two more oiled filo sheets so the tin is completely covered with pastry overhang all round. A few wrinkles/folds are fine.

8. Combine filling and fill the tin: Stir the ricotta mixture into the cooled spinach, then crumble in the feta and lightly stir so a few chunky pieces remain. Spoon the filling into the lined tin and level it.

9. Fold and top with filo: Bring the pastry sides up and over the filling, then brush them lightly with oil. Brush the remainder of the oil over the last filo sheet on the board. Cut that sheet in half widthways and lay one half at a time, in big folds, over the filling to cover it and create a pastry topping.

10. Bake: Place the tin on a heated baking sheet and bake at 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5 for 25–30 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and golden.

11. Rest and serve: Leave to cool for 10–15 minutes. Remove the tin and transfer the pie to a serving plate. If your tin doesn’t have a loose bottom, carefully upturn it onto a flat board, then flip it over onto the serving plate. Serve warm or cold with minted yogurt dip and a tomato, cucumber & pepper salad if you like.

Notes for a lighter, reduced-fat/salt version
- This recipe already uses rapeseed oil instead of butter and ricotta (lower-fat filling) to keep it lighter.
- Use reduced-fat ricotta and reduced-salt or lower-sodium feta if available to cut salt further; reduce or omit the added pinch of salt in the ricotta mix.
- Brush filo sparingly with the dill-oil mix to keep pastry crisp but lower in fat.",RELEVANT,"The content provides a lighter version of filo pastry spinach and feta pie (spanakopita) with spring onions, chives, and ricotta, including reduced-fat and reduced-salt suggestions, and full recipe steps."

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 30 minutes
Calories (kcal): not provided

Ingredients
- 2 tsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves
- 750 g sweet potato, peeled and cubed
- 1 L vegetable stock
- 2 rosemary sprigs
- 8 slices bread (ciabatta is good)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prep: Peel and cube the sweet potato, chop the onion, and separate the garlic cloves (you’ll use 2 crushed and 1 for rubbing on the bread). Strip the rosemary leaves from one sprig; keep the other sprig for rubbing on the bread.

2. Cook the aromatics: Heat 2 tsp olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and fry until soft (about 5–7 minutes).

3. Add garlic: Crush 2 garlic cloves and add to the softened onion. Fry for 1 minute more until fragrant.
