Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 65 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 225ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tins
- 300g plain flour
- 100g cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- pinch of salt
- 400g light brown soft sugar
- 300ml milk
- 2 tsp white wine vinegar
- 100ml strong coffee or espresso, cooled
- 2 tsp vanilla extract or paste
- 3 medium eggs

For the buttercream and decoration
- 400g butter, at room temperature
- 800g icing sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract or paste
- 4–5 tbsp milk (plus a splash more if needed)
- Food colouring pastes (e.g. pastel pink, purple and yellow)
- Edible flowers, pastel sugared almonds or mini chocolate eggs, to decorate

Equipment
- Three 20cm cake tins
- Baking parchment
- Electric whisk or stand mixer
- Piping bags (3) and scissors or piping tips
- Cake board or stand

Step-by-step instructions

1. Preheat and prepare tins
- Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.
- Oil three 20cm cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment.

2. Mix dry ingredients
- Weigh the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, light brown sugar and a pinch of salt into a large bowl.
- Whisk gently to combine. Shake the bowl to bring any lumps of sugar to the surface and squeeze them with your fingertips to break them up.

3. Combine wet ingredients
- In a jug, measure the oil, milk, white wine vinegar, cooled coffee and vanilla. Add the eggs and whisk together until combined.

4. Make the batter
- Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir with a whisk until smooth, ensuring there are no pockets of flour at the bottom — the batter will be quite runny.
- Divide the batter evenly between the three prepared tins.

5. Bake
- Place the tins on the middle shelf of the oven (or middle and top if they don’t all fit on one shelf).
- Bake for 25 minutes, then swap the tins around and bake a further 5 minutes (total about 30 minutes). Check doneness by inserting a skewer into the centre of each cake; if wet batter clings to the skewer, return the cakes to the oven for another 5 minutes and check again.

6. Cool and (optional) make ahead
- Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 30 minutes, then turn the sponges out onto wire racks to cool completely.
- If making ahead: once fully cool, wrap the sponges well and store in an airtight container for up to three days, or freeze for up to two months. Cakes often taste better after a day or two once the flavours have settled.

7. Make the buttercream
- Beat the room-temperature butter with an electric whisk or in a stand mixer for a few minutes until smooth and creamy.
- Add half the icing sugar and beat to combine. Add the remaining icing sugar, the vanilla and 4 tbsp milk and beat again until you have a smooth, fluffy buttercream. Add a splash more milk if needed to reach the desired consistency.

8. Colour the buttercream
- Divide the buttercream between three bowls.
- Add a few drops of different food colouring paste to each bowl (suggested: pastel pink, purple and yellow) and mix well until evenly coloured.

9. Assemble and pipe
- Spoon each coloured buttercream into its own piping bag and snip off the tips.
- Pipe a small dot of buttercream onto a cake stand or board and place one sponge on top to secure it.
- Using the purple buttercream, hold the piping bag directly above the cake about ½ cm from the surface. Squeeze and pull upwards to pipe small blobs with little peaks all over the top of the first sponge.
- Place the second sponge on top and repeat the piping process using the pink buttercream.
- Add the third sponge and pipe small blobs of yellow buttercream over the surface.

10. Decorate and store
- Decorate with edible flowers, sugared almonds or mini chocolate eggs as desired.
- The finished cake will keep in a tin at room temperature for up to five days.

Serving
- Bring to room temperature before serving if stored cool. Slice and serve as a showstopping Easter celebration cake.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a full chocolate-and-vanilla celebration cake recipe with pastel Easter-appropriate decoration, explicit make-ahead/storage instructions, and a note that it tastes better after a day or two—directly matching the request."

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 40 minutes
Calories (kcal): None

Ingredients
- 60g self-raising flour
- 3 tbsp cocoa powder
- 3 eggs
- 75g golden caster sugar, plus extra for scattering
- 200ml double cream
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- 50g icing sugar, sifted, plus extra to serve

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan)/gas 7. Line a 22 x 32 cm Swiss roll tin (20 x 30 cm is also fine) with baking parchment.
2. Sift the self-raising flour and cocoa powder together into a bowl and set aside.
3. Crack the eggs into another bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) and add the golden caster sugar. Use an electric whisk (or stand mixer whisk attachment) to beat the eggs and sugar together for about 5 minutes until the mixture is pale and very thick.
4. Gently fold the sifted flour and cocoa mixture into the beaten eggs and sugar with a spoon or spatula until completely incorporated and the batter is an even colour with no streaks.
5. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and spread to the corners. Bake for 9–10 minutes until the sponge is puffed up and springy to the touch.
6. While the sponge is baking, prepare another piece of parchment slightly larger than the tin and scatter it with a little caster sugar.

8. Score a line 2 cm from one of the shorter edges, then use the parchment to roll the sponge into a spiral with the parchment running through it. Leave the rolled sponge to cool completely.
9. Meanwhile, make the filling: whisk the double cream, vanilla extract and sifted icing sugar together until the cream stiffens.
10. Unroll the cooled sponge and spread the filling evenly over it, leaving the scored edge clear.
11. Starting from the scored edge, use the parchment to roll the sponge up around the filling. Lift the roll onto a board or serving platter and dust with extra icing sugar.

479d5a15-2ca9-4288-87ad-90cd94121cfd,Beginner-friendly kids' castle cake with chewing gum and sugar cube decorations — what ingredients and tips do I need?,"Recipe name: Easy castle cake

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 210 minutes

Calories (kcal): None

Ingredients:
- 300g soft butter
- 300g caster sugar
- 6 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 80g plain flour
- 300g self-raising flour
- 100g plain full-fat Greek yogurt
- 3 tbsp milk
- 8 tbsp seedless raspberry jam
- 150g soft butter (for butter icing)
- 300g icing sugar, sieved
- 600g ready-to-roll white icing
- 200g ready-to-roll pink icing
- 250g royal icing, made from a pack of royal icing sugar
- 100g ready-to-roll lilac or light blue icing
- 20 pieces chewing gum
- 40 sugar cubes
- silver balls
- green food colouring
- mini sugar blossoms
- edible glitter
- coloured cake board
- wooden skewer
- coloured sandwich flags or candles

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Heat the oven to 160°C/140°C fan/gas 3. Grease and base line a round 13cm cake tin and a round 18cm cake tin. Place two muffin cases in a muffin tin.

2. Put the 300g butter and 300g caster sugar into a large bowl and beat together until light and creamy. Add all the remaining cake ingredients (6 eggs, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, 80g plain flour, 300g self-raising flour, 100g Greek yogurt, 3 tbsp milk) except the jam and beat well.

3. Half fill the muffin cases and then fill the two cake tins 3/4 full. Bake in the oven placing the cake tins on one shelf and the muffin tin on another. Open the oven door and remove the muffins and smaller cake quickly when they are done as you don't want to let the heat out of the oven. The muffins will take about 35 mins, the 13cm cake about 1 hour 10 mins and the 18cm cake about 1 1/2 hours. You know each is done when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow the cakes to become completely cold before icing.

4. Trim the tops of the two cakes so they are flat. Slice each one in half, spread with 8 tbsp seedless raspberry jam and then sandwich together again. Using a 6cm cutter, cut each muffin to make a cylinder. Trim the tops flat. Sandwich together with jam to make a tower.

5. To make the butter icing put the 150g butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually beat in the 300g sieved icing sugar. Spread the butter icing over both cakes and the muffin tower. Roll out the 600g white icing and use to cover the two cakes. Place the larger one on a cake board. Put the smaller one on top. Roll a strip of white icing and wrap around the muffin tower. Place on top of the cake. Push a wooden skewer though the cakes to hold them together.

6. Using about 150g pink icing, mould into an onion shape for the dome. Put to one side. Roll out a little pink icing and cut out a 6cm round and place on top of the muffin tower. Using the made up royal icing (250g prepared), attach the dome to the top of the tower.

7. Using the pink icing make two doors and two curtains. Attach to the cake using royal icing. Make windows by rolling out the lilac icing and cutting out hearts using medium, small and tiny cutters. Attach these upside down to the cake with royal icing. Roll a small piece of lilac icing into a thin sausage and stick around the curtains to make the window frame.

8. Again using the royal icing, stick on the pieces of chewing gum around the doors, and the sugar cubes around the edge of the cakes. Attach silver balls to the dome to decorate and to the doors to make handles. Score horizontal lines down the doors to give a textured effect. Attach a piece of gum under each window on the middle tier and then stick three flowers on top to make window boxes.

9. Colour the remaining royal icing green and spoon into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. Pipe creeper branches up the castle walls. Attach mini sugar flowers.

10. Stick coloured flags or candles into the middle tier of the cake. Sprinkle a little edible glitter over the dome and sugar cubes.

4b1f6b22-2a75-4fcd-b1e4-f78442d9697e,Easy recipe for Curly Twirlies using ready-to-roll croissant pastry filled with toffee and dark chocolate (about 40 minutes)?,"Curly Twirlies
Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 40 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not stated

Ingredients
- 140 g soft toffee
- 100 ml milk
- 2 x tubes of 6 ready-to-roll croissants (we used Jus-Rol)
- 50 g dark chocolate drops (or use a block of dark chocolate and roughly chop)
- Golden icing sugar, for dusting

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / Gas 6. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
2. Put the soft toffees and the milk in a small pan. Melt very gently over a very low heat, stirring occasionally, until you have a smooth sauce. Remove from the heat and let it cool for 1–2 minutes so it thickens slightly and is less molten.
3. Unroll one tube of the ready-to-roll croissant dough. Pinch together the diagonal perforated seams so the dough holds together, then divide the dough into three rectangles along the straight crossing seams.
4. Cut each rectangle into 4 long, thin strips (you should end up with 12 strips from the first tube).
5. Drizzle a little of the cooled toffee sauce along the length of each strip, then scatter some dark chocolate drops over the toffee.
6. Unroll the second tube of croissant dough and cut it into the same size strips. Place these second strips on top of the toffee-and-chocolate-covered strips to sandwich them together.
7. Holding the ends of each sandwich strip, twist tightly to form a twirled stick and lay each twirl on the prepared baking sheets (they will expand a little while baking).
8. Once all twirls are shaped and arranged, bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until golden and crisp.
9. Remove from the oven and, once slightly cooled, dust lightly with golden icing sugar. Serve best freshly baked.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 45 minutes
Calories: 350 kcal

Ingredients
- 3 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp demerara sugar (reserve a little for sprinkling)
- 2 small eating apples, peeled, cored and diced
- Pinch each ground allspice and cinnamon
- 75 g blueberries
- 500 g pack puff pastry
- A little plain flour for rolling
- 1 egg, beaten (use some to glue the pastry and the rest as an egg wash)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the filling: in a medium saucepan melt the 3 tbsp butter with 3 tbsp of the demerara sugar. Stir in the diced apples and the pinches of allspice and cinnamon. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the fruit is slightly softened but not fully cooked through.
2. Remove the pan from the heat and fold in the blueberries. Set the filling aside to cool slightly.
3. Preheat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan) / gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper.
4. Lightly flour your work surface and roll the puff pastry out to about the thickness of a £1 coin (thin but not paper-thin). Cut out 8 squares approximately 11 cm across.
5. Prick each pastry square all over with a fork and transfer them to the prepared baking tray.
6. Divide the apple & blueberry filling among the pastry squares, spooning it into the centre of each square.
7. Bring the four corners of each square into the centre over the filling and pinch the corners together to form the Danish. Use a little of the beaten egg as glue where needed.

Difficulty: More effort

Ingredients
- 150 g cashew nuts  
- 50 g rolled oats  
- 4 Medjool dates, pitted (for the base)  
- 50 g coconut oil, melted (for the base)  

For the caramel filling:
- 350 g pitted Medjool dates  
- 125 ml unsweetened almond milk  
- 25 ml maple syrup  
- 150 g coconut oil  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- Generous pinch of salt (optional, to taste)

For the chocolate topping:
- 150 g coconut oil  
- 5 tbsp cocoa powder  
- 2 tsp maple syrup

Total cooking time: 35 minutes (active); plus chilling time — refrigerate for at least 3 hours to set
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prepare the tin: Grease a 20 cm (8-inch) square cake tin and line it with baking parchment.

2. Make the base: Tip the cashew nuts and rolled oats into a food processor and blitz until they form crumbs. Add the 4 pitted Medjool dates and the 50 g melted coconut oil, then blend again until the mixture sticks together. Transfer the mixture to the lined tin and press down firmly and evenly with the back of a spoon to form the base. Chill the base in the fridge while you make the caramel filling.

3. Make the caramel filling: Put the 350 g pitted Medjool dates, 125 ml almond milk, 25 ml maple syrup, 150 g coconut oil and a generous pinch of salt into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and boil for 2–3 minutes until the dates are very soft. Allow the mixture to cool slightly (the caramel will be hot), then tip it into a blender or food processor, add 1 tsp vanilla extract, and blitz to a smooth purée. Taste and add a little more salt if it’s too sweet. Pour the caramel over the chilled base and spread it to the sides of the tin, smoothing the surface. Return to the fridge to chill while you make the topping.

4. Make the chocolate topping: Gently heat the 150 g coconut oil in a small saucepan until melted. Remove from the heat and whisk in the 5 tbsp cocoa powder and 2 tsp maple syrup until smooth and lump-free. Let the chocolate mixture cool for about 10 minutes (so it’s not piping hot), then pour it over the caramel layer and smooth the top.

5. Set and serve: Return the tin to the fridge and chill for at least 3 hours (or until firmly set). Once set, lift the slab from the tin using the parchment, transfer to a board and cut into squares. Store in the fridge for up to a week.

Notes
- Be careful when blending hot caramel — allow it to cool slightly and hold the blender lid away from you a little to release steam.  
- Adjust sweetness or salt to taste in the caramel layer.  
- If coconut oil is very soft at room temperature in your kitchen, chill layers between steps so the layers don’t mix.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a home-baker friendly vegan millionaire's shortbread recipe that uses Medjool dates, maple syrup and rolled oats, with clear ingredients and step-by-step instructions—matching the request."

- 150 g caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp milk
- 2 medium eggs, beaten
- 50 g plain flour
- 75 g unsweetened cocoa powder
- 80 g milk chocolate chips

Step-by-step instructions
1. Cut the butter into small pieces. Put them in a 20 x 20 cm microwavable glass or ceramic dish and microwave in 20-second bursts until melted. Remove, swirl the melted butter around the dish to coat the sides, then tip it into a mixing bowl.

2. Add the caster sugar to the bowl. Using a hand or electric whisk, whisk vigorously until the mixture is creamy and fully incorporated into the melted butter.

3. In a jug, stir the vanilla extract into the milk, then add the beaten eggs and mix. Whisk this egg-milk-vanilla mixture a little at a time into the sugar-and-butter mixture, ensuring it’s thoroughly incorporated before adding more.

4. Sift the plain flour and unsweetened cocoa powder together, then fold them gently into the batter. Finally, stir in the milk chocolate chips.

5. Tip the whole mix back into the buttered 20 x 20 cm dish and smooth the top with a spatula so the mixture fills the dish evenly.

- 1 x 23cm zingy lemon cake (see related recipes)
- Icing sugar, for dusting
- 200g smooth apricot jam
- 500g pack marzipan
- 500g white ready-to-roll icing 'regal ice' (for the cake drum)
- 500g white ready-to-roll icing 'regal ice' (for the 15cm fruitcake)
- 1kg white ready-to-roll icing 'regal ice' (for the 23cm lemon cake)
- Light brown or 'teddy bear brown' food colouring paste
- Pink or 'fuschia' food colouring paste
- Blue or 'bluebell' food colouring paste
- Edible glue
- 500g icing sugar, sifted
- 250g unsalted butter, softened
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- 15cm (6"") cake tin and cake board
- 23cm (9"") cake tin and cake board
- 30cm (12"") cake drum
- A wide rolling pin
- A large smooth surface
- Cake smoother (optional)
- Toothpicks
- A paintbrush
- A small sieve or icing sugar dredger
- A 15cm cake box
- A 30cm cake box
- A selection of baby-themed biscuit cutters (used: teddy bear, a duck and a small rabbit). Note: don't use cutters over 7cm tall (too big for the cake depth).

Step-by-step instructions

1. Make the 15cm fruitcake.
   - Prepare and bake the 15cm light fruitcake (see related fruit cake recipe). You can make this up to a month in advance. Once cool, wrap in cling film. If desired, once a week feed it with a little dark rum or brandy: poke holes in the top and spoon a little spirit into the holes.

2. Marzipan the fruitcake.
   - Heat the 200g apricot jam until bubbling, sieve if necessary to remove bits, and set aside.
   - Level the top of the fruitcake with a long serrated bread knife.
   - Briefly knead the 500g marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll the marzipan into a circle big enough to cover the top and sides (use string or a tape measure to check dimensions).
   - Brush the cake with apricot jam, flip the cake over and position it on the 15cm cake board.
   - Brush the top of the cake with jam, then carefully transfer the marzipan over the cake. Smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, lifting and coaxing the marzipan to fit without overlapping. Trim excess marzipan at the base with a sharp knife.
   - You can marzipan the fruitcake up to a month in advance.

3. Ice the cake drum.
   - Lightly knead 500g of white ready-to-roll icing and form into a ball. Dust the work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll the icing into a circle large enough to cover the 30cm cake drum (use a tape measure to check).
   - Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the rolled icing to the drum. Gently roll over and trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Smooth again if desired to get a very neat finish. Be careful of fingerprints and fluff on ready-to-roll icing.
   - This can be done in advance; store in a cake box to keep it dust-free.

4. Make the 23cm lemon cake.
   - Prepare and bake the 23cm zingy lemon cake (see related lemon cake recipe). The unfilled cake can be wrapped in baking parchment and cling film and kept for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to a month.

5. Make the lemon buttercream.
   - Beat together 250g unsalted butter, 500g sifted icing sugar and the finely grated zest of 1 lemon to make a lemon buttercream. You can make this a day ahead.

6. Buttercream and prepare the 23cm lemon cake for icing.
   - Level the top of the lemon cake with a long serrated bread knife.
   - Spread a little buttercream onto the 23cm cake board and turn the cake upside down onto the board.
   - Brush all over with a thin layer of the sieved apricot jam to seal crumbs.
   - Horizontally cut the cake in half using the bread knife (it needn’t be perfect). Spread a layer of buttercream on the cut face, replace the top layer, and press down lightly to level. Spread remaining buttercream over the top and sides, smoothing with a palette knife.
   - Chill the cake in the fridge until the buttercream is firm to make icing easier.

7. Cover both cakes in ready-to-roll icing.
   - You will need approx. 500g icing for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one. For each cake, gently work the appropriate amount of ready-to-roll icing into a ball.
   - Dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll the icing into a circle large enough to cover the cake (use tape measure or string).
   - For the fruitcake: brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, transfer the rolled icing onto the cake and smooth down as you did with the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one.
   - For the lemon cake: the buttercream will act as glue—transfer and smooth the icing over the cake, then trim carefully. A ribbon around the base will hide any imperfections. Save leftover icing for decorations; wrap in clingfilm and place in a freezer bag to seal air out.

8. Prepare supports (dowels) for stacking.
   - Use three plastic dowels to support the top tier. Insert three dowels in a triangle pattern about 2cm in from where the edges of the smaller cake will sit.
   - With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on each dowel. Remove the dowels and set them side-by-side; pick the dowel with the highest mark and cut/snap the others to the same length (score with scissors and snap if plastic).
   - Reinsert the cut dowels (rounded end down) into the holes. Smooth a little leftover buttercream where the dowels are on the larger cake to help adhesion.

9. Stack the cakes.
   - Choose the best-facing side of the smaller cake for the front. Carefully lift the 15cm fruitcake and position it on top of the 23cm lemon cake, using a palette knife to help lower it evenly over the dowels.

10. Colour and prepare icing for decorations.
    - Pinch off a small ball of leftover white icing and leave it white.
    - Divide remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown (for teddies) by adding a little light brown/teddy bear brown colouring paste via a toothpick and kneading until smoothly coloured. Dye the remaining two quarters in pastel colours (pink and blue) using pink/fuschia and blue/bluebell pastes as desired.
    - Wrap all coloured icing balls in clingfilm and place in a freezer bag until ready to use to prevent crusting.

11. Cut and attach flat decorative shapes around tiers.
    - Roll out the brown icing and cut approximately 12 teddy shapes (size and number depend on your cutters; recommended not over 7cm tall). Alternate brown teddies with pink and blue ducks around the bottom tier (example: six brown teddies and six ducks—three pink and three blue).
    - For the top layer, cut about 12 small bunnies in alternating colours (brown, blue, pink, etc.).
    - Use a small amount of edible glue painted onto the back of each shape to stick them to the iced cakes with even spacing.

12. Model the teddy and rabbit toppers.
    - For the teddy:
      - Roll a small ball for the head and a slightly larger one for the body. Stick the head to the body.
      - Roll two small sausage shapes, one for legs and one for arms; cut each in half. Attach the arms to the sides of the body (flatten ends to form paws). Attach the legs, flattening ends for paws.
      - Make two small flattened balls for ears and cup them slightly; stick to the head.
      - Make a small white ball for a muzzle and attach to the face. Use a toothpick dipped in brown paste to dot eyes. Make tiny brown nose and small white buttons and stick them on. Add white pads for feet and inner ears if you like.
    - For the rabbit:

Difficulty: A challenge
Total cooking time: 190 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 300g unsalted butter, room temperature
- 300g caster sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 6 large eggs
- 400g self-raising flour
- 130g natural yogurt
- 2 tbsp milk (if needed)
- 50g caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 250g unsalted butter, softened
- 550g icing sugar
- 75g orange curd
- 3 tbsp raspberry jam
- 500g red sugarpaste
- 250g yellow sugarpaste
- 140g blue sugarpaste
- 100g brown sugarpaste
- 25g black sugarpaste
- 80cm length of yellow ribbon (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat and prepare the tin:
   - Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4.
   - Lightly grease a 23cm deep round cake pan and line the base with parchment paper.

2. Make the sponge:
   - Cream 300g room-temperature unsalted butter and 300g caster sugar together in a large bowl with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy (about 10 minutes).
   - Add 2 tsp vanilla extract and whisk to combine.
   - Beat the 6 large eggs a little with a fork, then with the beaters still running add the eggs a little at a time, waiting until each addition is fully combined before adding more.
   - Fold in 400g self-raising flour in three additions, alternating with 130g natural yogurt. If the finished batter feels a little stiff, mix in 2 tbsp milk to loosen it.
   - Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and level the top with a spatula.

3. Bake:
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover loosely with baking parchment for the last 15 minutes of cooking.
   - Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 minutes.

4. Make and apply the syrup:
   - While the cake is cooling in the tin, make the syrup: place 50g caster sugar, 50ml water and 1 tsp vanilla extract into a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few minutes until the sugar has dissolved.
   - Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely. Use a skewer to poke holes all over the top of the cake, then use a pastry brush to spread the syrup over the top, allowing it to soak into the sponge before adding more.

5. Make the buttercream:
   - Beat 250g softened unsalted butter and 550g icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy.
   - Add 75g orange curd and whisk again to combine.

6. Level and fill the cake:
   - If the cake is domed on top, use a large serrated knife to level it off. Cut the cake horizontally through the middle into two layers.
   - Place the bottom layer on a 23cm round cake board and spread a thin layer of the buttercream over it, then spread 3 tbsp raspberry jam on top.
   - Place the second layer of cake on top and spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake.

7. Cover the cake with red sugarpaste:
   - On a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, knead 500g red sugarpaste until soft and pliable.
   - Roll the red sugarpaste out to about 3–4mm thick and wide enough to cover the cake.
   - Roll the sugarpaste onto a rolling pin and carefully drape it over the cake. Gently smooth the sugarpaste down the sides and trim off the excess with a small sharp knife. Reserve the trimmings for decoration later.

8. Add yellow strips around the sides:
   - Roll out the 250g yellow sugarpaste to the same thickness. Cut 30 strips approximately 1.5cm x 10cm.
   - Dip your finger in water and brush a little onto the back of each strip (this acts as glue) and stick the strips to the sides of the cake all the way around. The strips should cover the full height of the cake but only reach a couple of centimetres over the top.

9. Add the blue circle and Duggee’s face:
   - Roll out the 140g blue sugarpaste to the same thickness as the red and yellow and cut out a 20cm circle. Stick the blue circle into place in the middle of the cake using a little water.
   - Roll out the 100g brown sugarpaste and use a thin sharp knife to cut out Duggee’s face and attach it to the blue circle.

10. Model Duggee’s clothes and facial details:
   - For Duggee’s clothes, knead a little yellow into the remaining brown sugarpaste until it becomes a light brown colour. Use this to cut out his shirt and lip area, sticking pieces with a little water.
   - Use the 25g black sugarpaste to form Duggee’s eyes and nose (shape by hand rather than rolling on the work surface). Use remaining sugarpaste to shape decorations for his outfit and mouth, attaching with a little water as needed.

11. Finishing touches:
   - Wrap the 80cm length of yellow ribbon around the bottom edge of the cake and secure with tape or a pin if desired (remember to remove before serving).
   - The cake will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 days.

- ½ tsp fine sea salt
- 150g milk chocolate, roughly cut into chunks

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4. Butter a 30cm x 20cm non-stick baking tin and line the base with non-stick baking parchment.

2. Melt the butter and dark chocolate: fill a small saucepan about one-third full with water and bring to a simmer. Put a snug-fitting heatproof bowl on top so it sits over (not touching) the water. Add the cubed butter and chopped dark chocolate and gently melt over low heat, stirring occasionally until smooth. Be careful not to let it burn. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool slightly.

3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and golden caster sugar together using an electric whisk for 8–10 minutes, until the mixture is thick and pale and leaves a trail (ribbon) when the whisk is lifted.

4. Gently fold the slightly cooled melted chocolate and butter into the egg-and-sugar mixture, along with the vanilla.

5. Sift or add in the gluten-free plain flour, cocoa powder and fine sea salt, and fold gently until just combined.

6. Fold in the milk chocolate chunks, reserving a few if you’d like to sprinkle some on top before baking.

7. Pour the batter into the prepared lined tin, smoothing the top. Place the tin in the centre of the preheated oven and bake for 30–35 minutes. The brownies should be just set on top with a slight wobble in the centre for a fudgy texture.

8. Remove from the oven and leave to cool a little in the tin. When slightly cooled, lift out using the parchment and cut into 12 squares. Leave to cool further if you prefer firmer slices.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 45 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 250 g pack unsalted butter (use a little for greasing; melt the rest)
- 50 ml whole milk
- 150 g whole natural yogurt
- ½ tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 3 large eggs
- 250 g light muscovado sugar (any lumps squashed)
- 250 g self-raising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 50 g cocoa powder (for the sponge)
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder (for the buttercream)
- 2 tbsp milk, plus 1 tsp more if needed (for buttercream)
- 200 g unsalted butter, very well softened (for buttercream)
- 300 g icing sugar (for buttercream)
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract (for buttercream)
- Large round cake board or a large flat plate, about 33 cm / 13 in
- 2 plastic diggers and one dumper truck, or similar toy vehicles
- 9 four-finger KitKat bars
- Handful Smarties or other coloured sweets
- Marker pen
- 10 x 5 cm rectangle of yellow cardboard
- 1 drinking straw
- Sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C) / gas 4. Grease the sides and bases of two 20 cm sandwich tins with a little of the butter and line if you prefer.

2. Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and stir in the 50 ml milk, 150 g yogurt and ½ tsp vanilla. Add the 3 eggs and beat well with a fork until combined.

3. In a large bowl put the dry ingredients: 250 g light muscovado sugar, 250 g self-raising flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 50 g cocoa powder and ¼ tsp salt. Whisk to combine (this aerates the mixture and avoids the need to sift).

4. Tip the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter. Don’t delay once mixed.

5. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared tins and place on the middle shelf of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

6. Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in the tins, then carefully invert them and leave to cool upside down on a wire cooling rack.

7. Make the chocolate buttercream: stir 2 tbsp cocoa powder into 2 tbsp milk until smooth. Put the 200 g very soft butter into a large bowl and sift the 300 g icing sugar on top. Add the cocoa mixture, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Beat with electric beaters for a few minutes until creamy and spreadable. If needed, add the extra 1 tsp milk to reach the right consistency.

8. Place one of the cooled cakes toward the back of the cake board or plate and fix it in place with a little buttercream so it doesn’t slip. Spread about one-quarter of the buttercream over it.

9. Sandwich the second cake on top. With a small serrated knife cut a scallop-shaped crater out of the top cake: cut about halfway down into the sponge and remove roughly a quarter of the top cake. Keep the piece you remove to crumble later. Position two diggers on the top to check crater size and shape, then set the toys aside.

10. Using a palette knife, spread the remaining buttercream evenly over the top and down the sides of the cake, making sure the edge of the excavated area is well defined.

11. Break the ends off enough KitKat fingers to follow the edge of the excavated area and press them into the buttercream. Now press the rest of the whole KitKat fingers around the outside of the cake to form a fence.

12. Crumble the piece of cake you removed to make “soil.” Part-fill the excavated hole with these crumbs and add a few Smarties if you like.

13. Position the plastic diggers on top and put some crumbs and Smarties into their buckets. Fill a dumper truck or lorry toy with more crumbs and Smarties and let some “soil” spill over the edge of the cake and the broken KitKats for a realistic effect.

14. Make the sign: write your message on the yellow cardboard with the marker and draw diagonal black lines to resemble a construction sign. Cut the straight part of the drinking straw into two equal pieces and tape these to the back of the card with sticky tape to make a signpost. Position the sign at the back of the cake.

15. Storage: If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for 2 days.

Difficulty: A challenge

Total cooking time: 120 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 300g butter, softened, plus extra for the tins
- 300g caster sugar
- 5 large eggs, beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 300g self-raising flour
- Purple gel food colouring (or a mixture of purple, blue and red gel colouring)
- 700g icing sugar
- 350g butter, softened
- Blue or purple gel food colouring
- Edible pearls and silver sprinkles, or extra optional decoration
- 200g white chocolate
- 2 tsp gold or metallic lustre (see tip below)
- Mermaid tail mould and small shell moulds, available online

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Make the white chocolate mermaid tails and shells:
   - Melt the 200g white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each turn until smooth.
   - Pour the melted white chocolate into the mermaid tail moulds and small shell moulds.
   - Put the filled moulds flat on a small tray and place in the freezer for 15–20 minutes until set. If you only have one mould, you can repeat this process to make additional tails.

2. Paint the tails with gold lustre:
   - Once the chocolate pieces are set, remove them from the moulds.
   - Mix the gold or metallic lustre (2 tsp) with ¼ tsp of water to make a paintable mixture.
   - Paint the lustre onto the mermaid tails (see any packaging tip if provided).
   - Put the decorated tails and shells back on a plate or tray in the freezer until needed.

3. Prepare and bake the sponge cakes:
   - Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/gas 4. Butter and line the base of three 18cm sandwich cake tins with baking parchment.
   - Using a stand mixer or electric hand whisk, beat together 300g softened butter, 300g caster sugar, the 5 beaten eggs, 1 tsp vanilla bean paste, 1 tsp baking powder and 300g self-raising flour until you have a fluffy mix.
   - Divide the mixture evenly between three bowls. Add a few drops of purple gel colouring (or mixed purple/blue/red) to each bowl, making each bowl a different shade of purple from dark to light.
   - Pour each coloured sponge mix into the separate tins and smooth the tops.
   - Bake for 25–30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
   - After 10 minutes, remove the cakes from their tins and transfer to a cooling rack, top-side facing down, and leave to cool. (Don’t worry if the outside doesn’t look purple — the inside will.)

4. Make the buttercream icing:
   - While the cakes are cooling, beat together 700g icing sugar and 350g softened butter until pale and fluffy. If necessary, mix in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture.
   - Set half of the icing aside in a bowl (reserve for crumb-coating/white accents).
   - Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue (dark, medium and light).

5. Assemble and crumb-coat the cake:
   - Stack the sponges, spreading most of the reserved white icing over each layer as you assemble.
   - Use the remaining white icing with a palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the stacked cake to create a crumb coat.
   - Chill the crumb-coated cake for 30 minutes.

6. Create the ombré piped outer finish:
   - Put each of the three blue icing shades into separate piping bags and cut a large (about 2cm) hole at the bottom of each bag.
   - Starting with the darkest shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring of icing around the whole cake, going two–three times around. Continue working upward with the next lighter shade, finishing with the lightest at the top.
   - Using a small palette knife, gently work around the joins between each piped row, pushing the icing to join each line together.
   - Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top.
   - Smooth the sides of the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombré finish, keeping the excess icing to decorate the top.

7. Decorate the top:
   - You can either mix all leftover icing together into a clean piping bag fitted with a star nozzle for a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual blue shades on the top.
   - Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves. Use some of the white icing to suggest the top of crashing waves.
   - Arrange and press the edible pearls, silver sprinkles, small chocolate shells and the gold-lustre-painted mermaid tails into the icing on the sides and on top of the cake to finish.

Stir in the chopped ginger and 100 g each of the almonds and pistachios. When the nuts are golden, toss in the dried cranberries, 2 tbsp of the honey, and the spinach so it wilts. Remove from the heat.

5. Combine squash and nut mixture
   - When the squash comes out of the oven, stir the shallot/nut/spinach mixture into the squash. Set this squashed-nut filling aside.

6. Make the hummus layer
   - In a food processor, whizz the chickpeas with the garlic, remaining olive oil, ground cumin, lemon juice, about 2 tbsp water and salt and pepper to taste to make a thick houmous. Stir in the chopped fresh coriander.

7. Prepare the filo shell
   - Melt the butter in a small pan. Put a loose-bottomed 28 cm quiche tin on a baking sheet and brush the tin with some of the melted butter. Keep the filo covered with a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out.
   - Lay one filo sheet over half the tin so it hangs over the edge by about 10 cm. Lay another sheet on the other side so they overlap in the centre and hang over the opposite edge. Brush with butter.
   - Lay two more filo sheets in the opposite direction in the same way and brush with more butter. Repeat to build up a total of eight filo sheets (brushing each layer with butter as you go).

8. Assemble the pie
   - Pile half the squash mixture in the centre of the pastry-lined tin. Spread the houmous over this, then top with the remaining squash mixture.
   - One at a time, bring the edge of each filo sheet up to the centre to cover the filling, creating voluptuous folds as you go. Brush the folded pastry carefully with more melted butter. (If making a day ahead: cover the assembled pie with cling film and chill. To reheat, remove from the fridge, heat the oven and bake for 35–40 minutes.)

9. Bake
   - Bake the pie for 30–35 minutes, until the filo is crisp and golden.

10. Finish with nut-honey glaze
   - Just before the pie is ready, reheat the remaining butter in the frying pan, tip in the remaining nuts (the 40 g left from earlier — or use any leftover nuts) and fry until golden. Spoon in the remaining 4 tbsp honey and, when it melts, take the pan off the heat and pour the nut-and-honey mixture over the baked pie. Dust with a little extra paprika if you like.

11. Make the harissa yogurt sauce
   - Mix the Greek yogurt and milk together to make a thinner sauce. Stir in the chopped mint and season. Swirl in harissa paste to taste (start with 2 tbsp and add up to 3 tbsp if you want more heat).

12. Serve
   - Serve slices of the pie with lemon wedges and the harissa yogurt sauce alongside.

Notes
- This is a celebratory, more-effort pie — the layers of roasted squash, spiced nuts, cranberries, honey and ginger make it richly flavoured and worth the time.
- If preparing ahead, assemble and chill, then bake from chilled for 35–40 minutes until piping hot and crisp.",RELEVANT,"The recipe is a vegetarian, celebratory pie that explicitly includes dried cranberries, honey and fresh ginger, is marked 'More effort' and matches the requested festive pie description, with full ingredients and instructions."

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 1 onion
- 40 g butter
- 100 g button mushrooms
- 40 g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 400 ml milk, warmed
- 1 chicken stock cube
- Pinch nutmeg
- Pinch mustard powder
- 1 bay leaf
- 250 g cooked chicken
- 200 g mix of sweetcorn, peas, chopped peppers, broccoli, carrots or other veg
- 250 g shortcrust pastry
- 1 egg, beaten (or milk) for glazing

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 200°C (fan 180°C) / gas 6. Peel and chop the onion as finely as possible.

2. Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Finely slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan with the onions; cook until almost done.

3. When the onions and mushrooms are almost cooked, add the 40 g plain flour to the pan and stir to make a thick paste (a roux). Crumble in the chicken stock cube and stir well. Continuously stir the roux over a low heat for 2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.

4. Slowly add the warmed milk to the pan, stirring all the time. Once all the milk has been added, season with salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of mustard powder. Add the bay leaf and bring the mixture to the boil, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.

5. When the sauce has thickened, add more milk or water if needed to reach a good pie-filling consistency. Bring briefly to the boil, then reduce to a very low heat. Chop the cooked chicken into even-sized pieces and add to the sauce. Stir in your chosen mixed vegetables, then pour the filling into your pie dish.

6. Lightly flour a clean surface and your rolling pin. Roll out the shortcrust pastry, trying not to tear it. Measure the pastry against the pie dish and once it’s slightly larger than the top, lift it carefully over the dish (using the rolling pin can help). Trim off excess pastry hanging over the edge and press the edges down with a fork or your fingers to seal and make a neat edge.

7. Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg or a little milk. Make a small hole in the centre of the pastry top to allow steam to escape. If you like, use leftover pastry to cut shapes to decorate the top.

8. Place the pie in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.

9. Remove from the oven and allow to sit briefly before serving. The pie is ready when the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbling.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a clear, easy-level recipe matching the described dish (crumbly chicken pie with bay leaf and milk-based sauce), with simple ingredients and step-by-step instructions—directly addressing suitability for beginner cooks."

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories (kcal): None

Ingredients
- 1 tsp fresh yeast, or ½ tsp fast-action dried yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 450g organic strong white flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 medium waxy potatoes, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 rosemary sprig, leaves picked and chopped, to serve

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the dough: In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in 350ml cold water and add 2 tbsp olive oil. Add the 450g flour and 1 tsp salt and mix thoroughly with your hands until you have a dough. Cover the bowl and leave the dough in the fridge or in a cool place overnight.

2. Next day — first shaping and fold-rests: Turn your dough out onto an oiled baking tray roughly 30cm x 20cm. Using your fingertips, gently stretch the dough into a rectangle, then fold it in half. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat the stretch-and-fold. Cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the stretching, folding and resting process two more times (so you do this sequence three times in total).

3. Final shaping: Heat the oven to 240°C/220°C fan/gas 9. Gently stretch the dough to fill your tray. If it springs back, don’t force it — rest for another 10 minutes and then try stretching again.

4. Top with potatoes and turmeric oil: Spread the thinly sliced potatoes over the dough, overlapping them. Mix the 2 tbsp olive oil with the 1 tsp turmeric and brush this mixture over the potato-topped dough. Sprinkle with sea salt.

5. Bake: Bake on the top shelf of the oven for 25–30 minutes, until the focaccia is cooked and golden.

6. Finish and serve: When cooked, drizzle with a little more olive oil and scatter over the chopped rosemary leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature with extra olive oil if desired.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 45 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 250g pack unsalted butter (some for greasing, rest for melting)
- 50ml whole milk
- 150g whole natural yogurt
- ½ tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 3 large eggs
- 250g white caster sugar
- 300g self-raising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 300g unsalted butter, very well softened (for buttercream)
- 450g icing sugar (for buttercream)
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract (for buttercream)
- 2 tsp whole milk (for buttercream)
- 2 heaped tbsp raspberry jam (or lemon curd) — optional, for filling
- 1kg white sugarpaste
- Green and pink food colouring paste (e.g. Spring Green and Fuchsia)
- A little sifted icing sugar for rolling out
- 38g tube Smarties
- 22 inch / 55 cm square cake board
- 100g royal icing sugar
- 100g desiccated coconut
- Blue food colouring paste
- 100g chocolate sprinkles

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C) / gas 4. Grease the sides and bases of two 20cm sandwich tins with a little of the butter from the 250g pack; melt the rest of that butter in a small saucepan.

2. Off the heat, add 50ml whole milk, 150g natural yogurt and ½ tsp vanilla to the melted butter, then add the 3 large eggs. Beat well with a fork until combined.

3. Put the dry ingredients (300g self-raising flour, 2 tsp baking powder) plus 250g white caster sugar and ¼ tsp salt into a large bowl. Whisk to combine and aerate.

4. Tip the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk to a smooth, silky batter. Don’t delay: pour the batter evenly into the prepared tins.

5. Bake on the middle shelf for about 25 minutes, or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the tins, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack.

6. Meanwhile make the buttercream: put 300g very well softened unsalted butter into a large bowl and sift 450g icing sugar on top. Add 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp milk and a pinch of salt. Beat with electric beaters for a few minutes until creamy, pale and spreadable.

7. Sandwich the two cakes with just under ¼ of the buttercream and then all of the jam (if using). Mark the assembled cake into six equal wedges and cut out two wedges — these two wedges will become part of the dinosaur’s head. (The main remaining part will be the body and the root of the tail.)

8. Chill all the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up the crumbs — this makes icing easier.

9. While the cake chills, colour the remaining buttercream with a little green food colouring gel.

10. Split the 1kg white sugarpaste into four pieces: one 500g, one 250g, one 150g and one 100g. Colour 250g green for legs and arms. Colour 150g pink for the spines.

11. Shape the 500g piece of sugarpaste into a tail, tapering it at the end. Flatten the other end so it can be moulded over the tail part of the cake (the shape will look a bit like a witch’s hat at this point). Position the cakes on the 22 inch / 55 cm cake board and anchor them with a little buttercream once you’re happy with placement — the main sponge will be the body and the two cutout wedges will form the face.

12. Using a palette knife, spread the coloured green buttercream over each piece of cake and over the tail to cover smoothly.

13. Shape 100g white icing into eyes and teeth and press them into the buttercream. Shape two small sausages of green icing to make an arm with two claws and position on the cake. Shape the remaining green sugarpaste into two legs; add claws if liked and press them into the buttercream on the dinosaur’s belly.

14. Shape the pink icing into spikes and position them along the spine and under the tail. Use two small pink sausages for eyelids if you like. Finally press the Smarties all over the dinosaur, saving two for the eyes. Leave to set.

15. To cover the board (optional): rub a few drops of blue colouring into the 100g desiccated coconut until even. Mix 100g royal icing sugar with about 2 tbsp water to a brushable consistency, then brush this all over the board and around the dinosaur. Sprinkle the coloured coconut and 100g chocolate sprinkles over the board and leave to set.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 95 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not specified

Ingredients:
- 150 ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 200 g plain flour
- 8 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 280 g light brown soft sugar
- 200 ml buttermilk
- 100 ml strong coffee or espresso
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2½ x 114 g packs milk chocolate fingers
- 8 tubes of sugar-coated chocolates, or other sweets
- 100 g milk chocolate, chopped into small pieces, plus 50 g (2 oz) for decorating
- 200 g slightly salted butter, softened
- 400 g icing sugar, sieved
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 bendy straw
- 2 wooden skewers
- 1 paper bag or sweet packet (see tip)
- Sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment. If your cake tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. In a bowl, mix the plain flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt. Break up any lumps in the sugar with your fingers.

3. In a jug measure the buttermilk, strong coffee, vegetable oil and vanilla. Add the eggs and whisk until smooth.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until well combined.

5. Divide the cake mixture evenly between the two prepared tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

6. Cool the sponges in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool completely. (Sponges can be made up to three days ahead and kept wrapped, or frozen for up to two months.)

7. To make the chocolate fudge icing: melt 100 g milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water (or carefully in short bursts in the microwave, stirring frequently). Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.

8. Meanwhile, mash the 200 g softened butter and 400 g sieved icing sugar together with a spatula, then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth. Sift in 4 tbsp cocoa powder, pour in the melted chocolate and add 2 tbsp milk, then mix until smooth.

9. Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the two sponges together on a cake stand or board. Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing — don’t worry about being too neat.

10. Immediately press the milk chocolate fingers around the sides of the cake. Do this straight after icing while the icing is still tacky so the chocolate fingers will stick.

11. Melt the remaining 50 g chocolate in the microwave or over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave it to cool until it reaches a spreadable consistency (you can chill briefly but stir every 5 minutes to avoid setting too hard).

12. For the gravity-defying topper: push one wooden skewer into the centre of the cake and then slip the bendy straw over the skewer — the skewer gives the straw extra stability. Push 1–2 cm of the straw into the cake.

13. Using a cutlery knife, put a blob of the melted 50 g chocolate onto a sugar-coated chocolate sweet and stick the sweet to the straw, starting at the base. Work in stages, allowing the chocolate to set a little between layers, until the straw is completely covered in sweets. If the chocolate becomes too firm, re-warm it gently.

14. Stop covering the straw when you reach the bend in the straw. Then stick the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so that it pokes out at an angle.

15. Place the paper bag (or sweet packet) on top of the skewer; you may need a little sticky tape to hold it in place. If any straw is exposed, cover it with more sweets.

16. Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface and finish the look.

1. Preheat and prep: Heat 1 tbsp butter in a large casserole dish (reserve the melted butter for brushing pastry later).

2. Cook aromatics: Add the finely chopped red onion, grated ginger and crushed garlic to the casserole and cook for 5 minutes until soft.

3. Add spices and chicken: Add 1 tbsp cinnamon, the cardamom seeds and 1 tsp turmeric. Stir around the pan for about 30 seconds until aromatic. Add the chicken thighs and 1 tbsp plain flour, stirring to coat the chicken pieces.

Fold the opposite side of the pastry over to cover the filling, then keep folding and flipping the encased filling down the pastry, brushing between layers with butter as you go, to form a triangular parcel (like a large samosa). Repeat until you have 6 pastillas.

10. Bake: Place the pastillas on a baking tray and brush the tops with the remaining beaten egg. Bake for 25 minutes until the pastry is crisp and golden.

- 1 tsp chopped rosemary, plus extra small sprigs to garnish
- 50 g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated
- 85 g gruyère, half diced, half grated

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan. Gently fry the thinly sliced garlic over low–medium heat for about 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Remove from the heat and set aside (reserve any garlic oil).

2. Heat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7. Prepare a baking sheet and dust lightly with flour.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 130 minutes

Calories (kcal): None provided

Ingredients:
- 300g cherry tomatoes, halved
- 4 small garlic cloves, sliced
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 4 tbsp tamarind paste
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 leek, halved and finely sliced
- 5 spring onions, finely sliced
- 300g spinach, wilted, excess water squeezed out and roughly chopped
- 400g feta, crumbled
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 2 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves, plus a few leaves to serve
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 6 filo pastry sheets
- 100g unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (140°C fan)/gas 3.

2. Make the sticky tamarind tomatoes:
   - In a bowl, mix the halved cherry tomatoes with the sliced garlic, half the olive oil, the tamarind paste, sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper.
   - Tip the mixture onto a baking tray and roast in the preheated oven for 25–30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are sticky and roasted. Remove and leave to cool a little.

3. Prepare the vegetable filling:
   - Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the sliced leek and spring onions and sauté, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.
   - In a large bowl combine the cooled leek and spring onion mixture with the squeezed and chopped spinach, crumbled feta, the roasted tamarind tomatoes, beaten eggs, chopped coriander, smoked paprika and seasoning. Mix well so the ingredients are evenly incorporated.

4. Assemble the filo rolls:
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan)/gas 6.
   - Keep the remaining filo sheets covered with a clean, damp tea towel so they don’t dry out. Take one sheet of filo, brush it with melted butter, lay another sheet on top and brush that with butter as well.
   - Spoon about one third of the filling along the long side of the filo rectangle and gently roll into a long tube. Repeat with the next two sheets and the remaining filling so you end up with three filled filo rolls.

5. Form the whirl:
   - Choose a round pie dish or an ovenproof pan. Carefully coil the three filo rolls from the outside of the dish toward the middle to form a large spiral. It’s fine if the filo cracks a bit — you can patch or layer extra filo to cover any gaps.
   - Brush the entire spiral with the remaining melted butter and sprinkle with the chilli flakes.

6. Bake:
   - Bake the whirl in the preheated 200°C (180°C fan) oven for 50–60 minutes, or until the filo is deep golden brown and crisp.

7. Finish and serve:
   - Remove from the oven and let rest briefly. Scatter the extra coriander leaves over the top before serving.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 45 minutes
Calories (kcal): None

Ingredients
- 250g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 30g caster sugar
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 100ml lukewarm milk
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 50g butter, softened
- Vegetable oil, for deep-frying
- 100g caster sugar (for coating)
- 1 tsp cinnamon (for coating)
- 200g icing sugar (for glaze)
- Sprinkles, freeze-dried raspberries or chocolate curls, to decorate (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix dry ingredients: Tip the flour, 30g caster sugar, the yeast and 1 tsp salt into a bowl and mix to combine.

2. Form the dough: Pour in the lukewarm milk, beaten egg and vanilla extract, and bring everything together with your hands into a rough dough, making sure all the flour is mixed in. (Or do this using a stand mixer.)

3. First rest: Cover the bowl with a clean, damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.

4. Knead and add butter: Tip the dough onto a clean surface and knead for 10–15 minutes by hand (or 5–8 minutes in a stand mixer on low speed) until springy and glossy. Use your hands to work the softened butter into the dough — this will take about 5 minutes. At first it may look like it’s not coming together; keep working it until smooth and glossy. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl.

5. First prove: Cover and leave in a warm place to prove for 2–3 hours, or until nearly doubled in size. (Line a baking tray with baking parchment for later.)

6. Shape doughnuts: Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 2cm thickness. Use a 9cm cutter to stamp out circles, then use a 4cm cutter to stamp out the middles to form rings. Re-roll trimmings (including the middles) and stamp out more rings — you should end up with about six ring doughnuts. Re-roll any remaining trimmings and use the 4cm cutter to stamp out five or six mini bites. Place the doughnuts and bites on the prepared tray.

7. Second prove: Cover the tray with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for another 2–3 hours, or refrigerate overnight until doubled in size. (The lightness of the doughnuts depends on this second proving; a longer prove in the fridge will give more flavour.)

8. Heat the oil: Fill a deep-fat fryer following manufacturer’s instructions, or use a heavy-based pan, ensuring it is no more than a third full of oil. Heat to 170°C (or test by dropping in a cube of bread — it should brown in about 30 seconds).

9. Fry the doughnuts: Carefully lift two or three doughnuts from the tray and slide them into the hot oil using a floured spatula. Fry for about 2 minutes on each side until puffed up and golden brown. Remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon or tongs. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, then fry all the mini bites for a total of about 2 minutes.

10. Cool and finish:
   - For sugar-coated doughnuts: Combine 100g caster sugar with 1 tsp cinnamon in a bowl and toss the warm doughnuts in the mixture to coat.
   - For glazed doughnuts: Sift 200g icing sugar into a bowl and mix in about 2 tbsp cold water until you have a runny icing. Dip the cooled doughnuts in the glaze and decorate with sprinkles, freeze-dried raspberries or chocolate curls if desired.

Total cooking time: 55 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 300 g baby spinach
- 50 g salted butter, melted, plus a small knob for frying
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 200 g feta, crumbled
- 7 shop-bought filo sheets
- 1 tbsp nigella seeds

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat and prepare: Heat the oven to 190°C / 170°C fan / gas 5. Brush a 24 x 4 cm deep metal pie dish with some of the melted butter.

2. Wilt the spinach: Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Tip in the spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted — you won’t need oil or water because it will steam in its own moisture. Leave to cool briefly, then tip the cooked spinach into a clean tea towel and squeeze out as much water as possible. Chop the squeezed spinach and put it in a bowl.

3. Cook the onion: Heat the knob of butter in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Tip the cooked onion into the bowl with the chopped spinach.

4. Make the filling: Stir the crumbled feta into the spinach and onion mixture using a fork until fully combined. Taste and season if needed.

5. Assemble the spirals: Lay one filo sheet on your work surface and brush it with some of the melted butter. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the spinach-feta filling in a line along the longest edge of the pastry. Roll the sheet loosely into a long sausage (avoid rolling too tight to prevent the pastry splitting). Coil the rolled pastry into the centre of the prepared tin. Repeat with the remaining filo sheets and filling, arranging each roll as a coil around the central one so you form a spiral that fills the dish.

6. Finish and seed: Brush the tops of the assembled spirals with more melted butter and sprinkle with the nigella seeds.

7. Bake: Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 25–30 minutes, until golden and crisp.

8. Rest and serve: Remove from the oven, allow to cool slightly for a few minutes, then slice and serve warm.

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat and prepare the tin
   - Heat the oven to 200°C / 180°C fan / gas 6. Butter a deep 30 x 23 cm rectangular tin.

2. Make the cake batter
   - Beat 350g softened unsalted butter and 350g golden caster sugar together in a stand mixer (or by hand) until pale and light, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the 6 eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
   - Sift in 350g self-raising flour and 1 tsp baking powder. Add the zest of 2 lemons and 50ml milk.
   - Fold everything together gently using a large metal spoon until just combined.

3. Bake the cake
   - Spoon the batter into the prepared tin, smoothing the top.
   - Bake for 35–40 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
   - Leave the cake to cool for 10 minutes in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

4. Prepare the lemon syrup
   - Mix 4 tbsp caster sugar with the juice of the 2 lemons to make the syrup.

5. Slice and brush
   - Transfer the cooled cake to a board and carefully cut it in half horizontally through the equator so you have two layers.
   - Put one half on a baking tray or board. Brush the cut sides of both cake halves with the lemon syrup to add moisture and flavour.

6. Make the buttercream
   - Beat 175g softened unsalted butter in a stand mixer to loosen.
   - Slowly add 350g sieved icing sugar and a splash of water if needed, and continue to beat until pale and spreadable.

7. Assemble the cake
   - Spread 4 tbsp jam over the base cake layer.
   - Carefully spread about one-third of the buttercream over the jam layer.
   - Place the other cake half on top to sandwich them together.
   - Using a serrated knife, cut the stacked cake into the shape of your desired number. Try to waste as little cake as possible — offcuts make a nice treat.

8. Finish and decorate
   - Spoon the remaining buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe swirls or other decorations over the shaped number.
   - Top with mini meringues, biscuits, macarons, raspberries or any other toppings you like.

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.
   - Grease 3 x 20cm sandwich tins, line the bases with baking parchment and grease the parchment.

2. Make the sponge batter
   - Put 225g softened butter and both sugars (175g golden caster and 175g light brown soft sugar) in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the 4 eggs a little at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding more.
   - In another bowl, mix together 325g plain flour, 25g cornflour, 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp mixed spice, and 1½ tbsp baking powder.
   - Stir the dry ingredients into the butter-sugar-egg mixture in three additions, alternating with the 300ml full‑fat milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.
   - Divide the batter evenly among the prepared tins, smooth the surfaces.

3. Bake and cool the sponges
   - Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
   - Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and peel off the parchment. Cool completely.

4. Make the caramelised pears
   - Peel, core and dice the 4 conference pears into small cubes, tossing with the juice of half a lemon as you go.
   - Tip the pear pieces into a frying pan with 3 tbsp maple syrup and 2 tbsp unsalted butter.
   - Cook over medium–high heat until the pears have softened and most of the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool.

5. Make the maple Swiss meringue buttercream
   - Put 4 large egg whites and 320g light brown soft sugar in a large heatproof bowl (the bowl of a stand mixer is ideal). Place the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water.
   - Whisk continuously until the sugar has fully dissolved — test by rubbing a little between your fingers; it should be smooth with no graininess.
   - Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk (by hand or with a mixer) until the mixture forms a thick meringue and has cooled to room temperature.
   - With the mixer running, slowly beat in the 480g softened unsalted butter, 1 tbsp at a time, until a silky-smooth buttercream forms. If it’s too warm and won’t thicken, chill 10 minutes then continue whisking.
   - Whisk in the 6 tbsp maple syrup last, to taste.

6. Assemble the cake
   - Place the first sponge on a cake board or serving plate and spread a thin layer of buttercream over it.
   - Top with half of the caramelised pear chunks (drain any excess liquid first).
   - Repeat with the second sponge, another thin layer of buttercream and the remaining caramelised pears, then place the third sponge on top.

7. Crumb coat and ruffle finish
   - Spread a very thin layer of buttercream over the sides and top of the assembled cake to create a crumb coat. Chill briefly if needed to set.
   - Spread a thick layer of buttercream on top of the cake.
   - Fit a piping bag with a small petal piping tip (or a small petal/nozzle). Put the remaining buttercream into the piping bag.
   - Hold the piping bag with the wide end of the nozzle touching the side of the cake at the very bottom. Gently wiggle the bag side-to-side in a zigzag motion, moving upward in a strip to create ruffles. Repeat, working around the cake and starting each new strip next to the previous one, until the sides are entirely covered.
   - Pipe one row of buttercream around the edge of the top of the cake to neaten the top edge of the ruffles.

8. Decorate
   - If using, finish with a light coat of edible gold spray for sparkle. Allow any spray to dry before handling.

9. Serving and storage
   - Best served within 2 days of baking; the cake will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge.

Notes/tips
- Make sure the meringue has cooled to room temperature before adding butter to avoid a runny buttercream.
- Drain caramelised pears well before assembling so the filling doesn’t make the cake soggy.

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / gas 6. Line baking sheets or prepare them lightly.
2. In a bowl, beat the softened butter with the 50 g golden caster sugar and 50 g icing sugar until creamy.
3. Add the 2 egg yolks and 2 tsp vanilla extract and mix until combined.
4. Stir the 300 g plain flour into the butter mixture in two batches, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the orange zest.
5. Roll the dough into about 22 walnut-sized balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets, allowing a little space between each.
6. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cookies are golden. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the baking sheet briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
7. While the cookies cool, make the icing: mix the 140 g sifted icing sugar with enough orange juice (from the zested orange) to make a thick but pourable/runny icing.
8. Dip one half of each cooled cookie into the icing, then immediately press into sprinkles to decorate. Set the decorated cookies on a wire rack to dry and set.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 110 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 300 ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 400 g plain flour
- 130 g cocoa powder
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 560 g light brown soft sugar
- 400 ml buttermilk
- 200 ml strong coffee or espresso
- 4 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs
- 250 g pack slightly salted butter, softened
- 600 g icing sugar
- 280 g tub full-fat cream cheese
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 10 filled chocolate biscuits (about ¾ of a pack), plus extra filled chocolate biscuits as needed for toppers
- Thin wooden skewers
- 100 g white chocolate, finely chopped
- Ready-to-roll fondant icing, coloured (or an icing writing pen)

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas mark 4. Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment. If tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. For the first sponge batch: Put 200 g plain flour, 8 tbsp (about 64 g) cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280 g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are lumps in the sugar, break them up with your fingers.

3. Measure 200 ml buttermilk, 100 ml coffee, 150 ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla into a jug. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined.

4. Divide the cake mixture evenly between the two cake tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.

5. Repeat steps 2–4 to make a second batch so you have 4 sponge layers in total. (These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or can be wrapped well and frozen for up to two months.)

6. To make the cream cheese biscuit icing: Put the 250 g softened butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the 600 g icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then use a hand mixer to whisk until smooth. Add the 280 g tub of full-fat cream cheese and the 2 tsp vanilla, then sieve in the remaining icing sugar. Mash and blend again with the hand mixer until smooth.

7. Put the 10 filled chocolate biscuits into a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the cream cheese icing and mix until combined.

8. Make cookie cake toppers (optional): You’ll need one biscuit per letter of the word you want (name or message). Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit (some may break—have extras). Melt the 100 g white chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, or in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Spread a little melted chocolate over the surface of one side of each biscuit.

9. Roll out the ready-to-roll fondant icing to about the thickness of a 50p coin and cut out letters. Stick the letters to the chocolate-covered side of each biscuit and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry and use an icing pen to write directly on the biscuit surface.

10. Assemble the cake: Stick one sponge to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese biscuit icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining sponges, spreading a generous layer between each. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface.

11. Finish and decorate: If you have leftover biscuit crumbs, break them into pieces and press them around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie toppers into the top of the cake.

12. Serve and store: Serve chilled or at room temperature. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days; bring the cake back to room temperature for an hour or so before serving for best flavour and texture.

   - Melt the white chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little melted white chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie.
   - Roll out the ready-to-roll fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin and cut out letters, then stick these to the chocolate-covered cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the cookie surface.
   - Use coloured fondant (blue/green) as desired for decorating toppers.

8. Assemble the cake:
   - Stick one sponge to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing.
   - Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining sponges on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer.
   - Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate as needed.

9. Finish decorations:

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 70 minutes
Calories (kcal): not provided

Ingredients
- a little oil, for greasing
- 400g pack pork and apple sausage (about 6 fat sausages)
- 1 roasted red pepper from a jar, patted dry with kitchen paper
- 1 large egg
- ½ tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- flour, for dusting
- 250g ready-made puff pastry
- baked beans or salad, to serve

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C / 180°C fan / gas 6. Grease a baking tray lightly with oil and line it with baking parchment. Set aside.

2. Remove the sausagemeat from the skins: snip off the ends of each sausage and squeeze the meat into a bowl.

3. Prepare the pepper and egg: pat the roasted red pepper dry and cut it into small pieces with scissors. Break the egg into a small cup, beat with a fork and reserve about 2 tbsp of the beaten egg for glazing.

4. Make the filling: add the red pepper, the remaining beaten egg, the chilli flakes (if using) and the tomato purée to the sausagemeat. Purée/mix everything together until well combined (use a fork or your hands).

5. Roll out the pastry: dust your work surface with a little flour. Using a rolling pin, roll the puff pastry into a rough square about 30 x 30 cm. Transfer the pastry to the lined baking tray.

6. Shape the filling: spoon the sausage mixture down the centre of the pastry in a sausage shape, leaving about 3 cm gap at both top and bottom.

7. Cut strips for plaiting: on each side of the filling, cut the pastry at a slight diagonal into even strips about 1.5 cm wide (aim for the same number of strips on each side — the original used 12 strips each side).

8. Brush with egg: brush most of the reserved beaten egg over the pastry (this helps the strips stick and browns the pastry).

9. Fold edges and plait: tuck the top and bottom edges of the pastry over the filling to seal. Starting at the top, take one strip from each side in turn and lay them across the filling, crossing them over to form a plait. Continue down to the bottom.

10. Glaze and bake: brush the plait all over with the remaining beaten egg. Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and cooked through.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 60 minutes
Calories: 246 kcal

Ingredients
- 2 tsp fast-action dried yeast
- 500 g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 300 ml warm water (mentioned in the method)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix the yeast with 300 ml warm water in a large bowl. Leave to sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is super bubbly, then tip in the flour, salt and olive oil. Bring the mixture together into a soft dough. Don’t worry if it looks a little rough round the edges.

2. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 5–10 minutes until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough. Try to knead using as little extra flour as possible, just enough so that the dough doesn’t stick – this will keep the pittas light and airy. Once kneaded, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to double in size, approximately 1 hour.

3. Heat the oven as high as it will go (ideally 250°C / 230°C fan / gas 9) and put a large baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven to get searingly hot. Divide the dough into eight balls then flatten each into a disc with the palm of your hand. On a lightly floured surface, roll each disc into an oval, around 20 cm long, 15 cm wide and 3–5 mm thick.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 95 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 240g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 120g unsalted butter, cut into cubes, then chilled
- 2 tsp yeast extract
- A good pinch of salt
- 4 medium eggs
- 175ml whole milk
- 150g piccalilli, any large pieces chopped
- 125g mature cheddar, finely grated
- 1 tsp onion seeds
- 1–2 tbsp cold water (see method)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the pastry: put the flour in the bowl of a food processor. Add the chilled butter cubes, the yeast extract and a good pinch of salt. Whizz until you have a crumbly mixture that starts to clump.

2. With the processor running, add 1 tbsp cold water at a time, whizzing as you go (you should need about 2 tbsp in total). Stop as soon as the dough comes together — don’t add more water than needed.

3. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and lightly roll out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Wrap the pastry and chill for 30 minutes.

4. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured surface until large enough to line a 20cm fluted (4cm high), loose-bottomed tart tin, leaving some overhang. Carefully use the rolling pin to lift the dough and lay it into the tin, encouraging it into the base and up the fluted sides. Leave any excess overhanging the rim.

5. Put the lined tin in the freezer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4 and place a baking tray on the middle shelf.

6. Remove the tart case from the freezer. Prick the base all over with a fork. Line the case with a scrunched sheet of baking parchment, pressing it into the base and up the sides, then fill with baking beans (or dried rice/lentils) to weigh it down.

7. Bake the lined tart on the hot tray for 25 minutes. Remove the parchment and baking beans, trim off excess pastry with a small serrated knife, then return the tart case to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes until the base is cooked and beginning to colour.

8. While the tart shell finishes, whisk together the 4 eggs and 175ml whole milk in a jug with some seasoning until combined.

9. Remove the tart case from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Spread the chopped piccalilli evenly over the base, then sprinkle over the grated cheddar. Carefully pour the egg-and-milk mixture over the filling and sprinkle the onion seeds on top.

10. Return the tart to the baking tray and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, until the filling is set but with a slight wobble in the centre.

11. Leave the tart to cool completely in the tin, then chill until cold before cutting into wedges to serve. The tart will keep chilled for up to three days.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 70 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 500 g tomatoes (use a mixture of sizes and colours), cut into ½ cm pieces
- 50 g Gruyère (or vegetarian alternative), coarsely grated
- 1 garlic clove, finely grated
- 1 tbsp chopped oregano or thyme
- 225 g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 100 g cold butter, cut into cubes
- 2 eggs, plus extra beaten egg for brushing
- Salt and black pepper

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prepare the tomatoes: Tip the cut tomatoes into a colander set over a large bowl. Sprinkle over 1 tsp salt, toss gently, and set aside for 1 hour to draw out excess moisture.

2. Make the pastry (while the tomatoes are draining): Tip the flour, butter and a good pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Beat the 2 eggs in a jug, then add them to the processor and pulse to form a soft dough. If the dough seems dry, add ½ tsp cold water at a time until it comes together. Shape the dough into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for 20 minutes.

3. Preheat the oven: Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 45 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 250g pack unsalted butter
- 50ml whole milk
- 150g whole natural yogurt
- ½ tsp vanilla paste or extract
- 3 large eggs
- 250g light muscovado sugar (any lumps squashed)
- 250g self-raising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 50g cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp milk, plus 1 tsp more if needed
- 200g unsalted butter, very well softened
- 300g icing sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or extract
- Large round cake board or a large flat plate, about 13 inches / 33 cm
- 2 plastic diggers and one dumper truck, or similar
- 9 four-finger KitKat bars
- Handful Smarties or other coloured sweets
- Marker pen
- 10 x 5 cm rectangle of yellow cardboard
- 1 drinking straw
- Sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan 160°C) / gas mark 4. Grease the sides and bases of two 20 cm sandwich tins with a little of the butter.

2. Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the 50 ml milk, the yogurt and the vanilla, then whisk in the eggs. Beat well with a fork until combined.

3. Put the dry ingredients (250 g self-raising flour, 2 tsp baking powder, cocoa powder as listed, plus ¼ tsp salt) into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Tip in the wet ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter.

4. Pour the batter evenly into the two prepared tins without delay and put them on the middle shelf of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

5. Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in the tins, then carefully invert them onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely.

6. While cakes cool, make the chocolate buttercream: stir the cocoa into 2 tbsp milk until smooth. Put 200 g very soft unsalted butter into a large bowl and sift the 300 g icing sugar on top. Add the cocoa mixture, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Beat with electric beaters for a few minutes until creamy and spreadable. Add the extra 1 tsp milk if needed to reach a spreadable consistency.

7. To assemble, place one of the cakes toward the back of your cake board or plate and secure it with a little buttercream so it doesn't slip. Spread about a quarter of the buttercream over this layer.

8. Sandwich the second cake on top. With a small serrated knife, cut away a scallop-shaped crater from the top cake: cut about halfway down into the sponge and remove roughly a quarter of the top. Keep the removed piece — you will crumble it later for ""soil"". Position two diggers on the top to check crater size, then set them aside.

9. Using a palette knife, spread the remaining buttercream evenly over the top of the cake and down the sides, making sure the edge of the excavated area is well defined.

10. Break enough KitKat fingers so their ends match the edge of the excavated area and press them into the buttercream around the top edge of the crater. Then fix the remaining whole KitKat fingers around the side of the cake to form the retaining wall.

11. Crumble the piece of cake you removed in step 8 to make ""soil"". Part-fill the excavated hole with these crumbs and add a few Smarties among the crumbs if you like. Position the diggers on top and add some crumbs and Smarties into their buckets.

12. Fill the dumper truck with more crumbs and Smarties and let some ""soil"" spill over the edge of the cake and the broken KitKats for a realistic effect.

13. Make the construction sign: use the marker to write your message on the 10 x 5 cm yellow cardboard and draw diagonal black lines. Cut the straight part of the drinking straw into two equal pieces and tape them to the back of the cardboard to make a signpost. Position the sign at the back of the cake.

14. Storage: if the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), store the finished cake in a cool place (not the fridge). The cake will keep for up to 2 days.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 100g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for the tin
- 4 ripe bananas
- 50g full-fat natural yogurt, plus 2 tbsp
- 100g spelt flour
- 120g plain flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 2 eggs
- 160g golden caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 40g walnuts, broken
- 200ml double cream
- 40g unsalted butter, diced
- 150ml double cream
- 130g light muscovado sugar
- generous pinch sea salt

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Prepare a muffin tin by thoroughly buttering and lining with cases. In a bowl, mash three bananas, then stir in 50g yogurt. In another bowl, sift in the flours, baking powder, cardamom and a pinch of salt, and stir to combine.

2. Add the eggs and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer, then whisk until pale and frothy – about 3 minutes. Slowly pour in the melted butter in a steady stream, then add the vanilla. Turn the speed down, then add the flour mixture, 2 tbsp at a time, alternating with the yogurt and banana mix, until everything is incorporated. Mix in the walnuts for no longer than 20 seconds. Divide the mixture between the muffin cases. Bake for 25–30 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.

3. Meanwhile, make the salted caramel by heating the 40g diced butter, 150ml double cream and 130g light muscovado sugar in a non-stick pan until simmering. Remove from the heat, then add the generous pinch of sea salt – you want enough to pique the sauce, but it shouldn’t taste salty.

4. Once the muffins are cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack. Whip the 200ml double cream to soft peaks, fold through 2 tbsp yogurt and slice the final banana. Spoon or pipe the cream onto the muffins.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 40 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 360 ml aquafaba (the liquid from 2 x 400 ml cans of chickpeas)
- 230 g caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
- 1 vanilla pod, seeds removed
- 150 g self-raising flour
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 200 g coconut yogurt (or coconut cream), set aside in the fridge for a few hours before lightly whisking
- 2 tbsp icing sugar, plus extra for dusting
- 150 g marmalade
- 2 balls of stem ginger, finely chopped

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan) / gas 5. Line a 23 x 33 cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment.

2. Pour the aquafaba into a large clean bowl and whisk for about 6 minutes (or until it reaches soft peaks).

3. With the whisk running, add the caster sugar and the vanilla seeds a spoonful at a time, whisking between each addition until the aquafaba turns to stiff peaks.

4. Sieve the self-raising flour together with the ground ginger. Using a metal spoon, gently fold the flour mixture into the whipped aquafaba, taking care to retain as much air as possible.

5. Pour the batter into the lined tin and smooth the surface with a spatula so it’s evenly spread. Bake for about 20 minutes, until just firm to the touch.

6. While the sponge is baking, lay a sheet of baking paper on your work surface and dust it with caster sugar.

7. When the sponge is baked, turn it out onto the sugared paper and peel off the baking parchment from the bottom. Allow it to cool a little, then use the sugared paper to gently roll up the sponge from the shortest edge. Leave it rolled up to cool a little longer (this helps it keep its shape and makes re-rolling easier later). Once cooled a little, gently unroll and let it cool completely.

8. Meanwhile, whisk the chilled coconut yogurt or cream with the 2 tbsp icing sugar until thickened.

9. When the sponge is completely cool, spread the marmalade over it, leaving a 2 cm border around the edges. Scatter the chopped stem ginger over the marmalade. Spread the thickened coconut yogurt or cream on top of the marmalade, keeping the 2 cm border clear.

10. Use the sheet of baking paper to help you roll the sponge back into the roulade shape. Remove the baking paper, trim the ends for neatness, and place the roulade on a serving dish.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 200g plain flour
- 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 65g icing sugar
- 1 large egg yolk
- pinch of salt
- 175g raspberry jam
- 50g desiccated coconut, lightly toasted
- 12 maraschino cherries
- For the custard:
  - 800ml whole milk
  - 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
  - 5 large egg yolks
  - 100g caster sugar
  - 50g custard powder

Step-by-step instructions
1. Make the pastry: Put the flour and cold cubed butter in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the icing sugar and a pinch of salt. Add the egg yolk and bring the mixture together into a dough. If it’s too dry, add 1–2 tbsp cold water. Tip the dough onto a work surface and form into a rough ball; knead very briefly.

2. Roll and chill the pastry: Roll the pastry out between two sheets of baking parchment into a roughly 28cm circle. Chill for 20–30 minutes until firm. Use the pastry to line a 23cm tart tin, pushing it into the corners and trimming the edge so there’s about 1–2cm pastry overhanging the rim. Don’t worry about small breaks — patch with off-cuts. Prick the pastry base several times with a fork, then chill again for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.

3. Blind-bake the case: Line the chilled pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment and fill to the top with baking beans, uncooked rice or lentils. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 10–15 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, then trim any excess pastry using a small serrated knife.

4. Make the custard: While the pastry is cooling, bring the milk and vanilla bean paste to the boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. In a medium bowl, beat the 5 egg yolks with the caster sugar and the custard powder until well combined.

5. Combine milk and egg mixture: Slowly pour the hot milk over the egg mixture, whisking continuously until smooth and well combined. Tip the mixture back into the pan and cook over medium–low heat, stirring continuously for 2–3 minutes until very thick. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.

6. Assemble the tart: Spread the raspberry jam evenly over the base of the cooled pastry case. Carefully pour the warm (not piping hot) custard over the jam and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon or a spatula.

7. Finish and chill: Sprinkle the lightly toasted desiccated coconut over the custard. Dot the maraschino cherries around the edge in a neat circle.

8. Set: Chill the tart in the fridge for 2–3 hours, or until fully set, before serving.

For the ganache drip
- 100 g dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 75 ml double cream

Decoration
- 37 g pack Maltesers (plus extra as desired)
- Honeycomb shards and crumbs (from honeycomb above)

Step-by-step instructions

1. Prepare and preheat
- Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/Gas 4.
- Grease and line the bases of two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment.

2. Make the malt sponges
- In a large bowl, put 200 g softened butter and 250 g golden caster sugar and whisk until pale and fluffy.
- Add the 3 eggs one at a time, whisking well between each addition.
- Tip in 225 g plain flour, 25 g powdered malt drink and 2 tsp baking powder with 1/4 tsp salt; fold together.
- Add 100 g natural yogurt and 2 tsp vanilla extract and stir briefly to combine.
- Divide the batter between the 2 lined tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25–30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
- Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then remove, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. (Sponges can be made up to 2 days ahead, cooled and wrapped in cling film.)

3. Make the chocolate sponges
- Grease and line the bases of the tins again.
- In the same mixing bowl (no need to wash), cream 175 g softened butter and 250 g golden caster sugar until pale and fluffy.
- Add the 3 eggs one at a time and mix until combined.
- Sift in 225 g plain flour, 25 g cocoa powder and 2 tsp baking powder with 1/4 tsp salt and fold together.
- Add 50 g natural yogurt, 100 g melted dark chocolate and 100 ml boiling water; stir until combined.
- Divide the batter between the 2 tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, testing with a skewer as before.
- Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out, remove the parchment and cool completely.

4. Make the honeycomb (decoration)
- Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil.
- Put 200 g golden caster sugar and 5 tbsp golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel — do not stir.
- When the caramel reaches the desired colour, add 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. The mixture will foam.
- Pour the foaming mixture onto the greased baking tray and set aside for about 30 minutes to cool and firm up.
- Once set, break into shards for decorating the top of the cake and reserve crumbs for garnish.

5. Make the cream-cheese malt buttercream
- In your largest mixing bowl, beat 250 g softened butter with half of the 750 g icing sugar, 3 tbsp powdered malt drink and 1 tsp vanilla extract until smooth.
- Add the remaining icing sugar and 280 g full-fat cream cheese and beat again until well combined. Do not overmix (overmixing can make the icing runny).

6. Assemble the cake (4 layers)
- Put one sponge on a cake stand or cake board and secure it with a small blob of icing.
- Use one-quarter of the buttercream to stack the cakes, alternating between malt and chocolate sponges (you should end up with four layers: malt/chocolate/malt/chocolate or whichever order you prefer). Use even amounts between layers.
- Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up.
- Apply a thin layer of buttercream all over the cake (crumb coat) to fill gaps and trap crumbs.
- Chill the crumb-coated cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes to firm the icing.

7. Final icing
- Remove the cake from the fridge and use the remaining buttercream to completely cover the cake. The easiest method is to pile the icing on top, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edges and down the sides.
- Smooth or texture the finish as you like.
- Chill the cake again for about 30 minutes to firm the buttercream before applying ganache.

8. Make the ganache drip
- Put 100 g finely chopped dark chocolate in a bowl.
- Heat 75 ml double cream in a small pan until just steaming (do not boil).
- Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and leave to sit for 5–10 minutes, then stir to make a glossy ganache.
- Allow the ganache to cool and thicken slightly until it is pourable but not too runny (so it drips down the sides in droplets).

9. Apply the drip and finish
- Remove the cake from the fridge. Starting at the back, spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drip down the sides. Practice on the back to get the hang of the drips.
- Fill in the centre of the top of the cake with more ganache.
- Break the honeycomb into tall shards and arrange them on top of the cake.
- Finish with whole and halved Maltesers and sprinkle some honeycomb crumbs around the base or top as desired.

10. Serve and store
- The cake is best served within 2–3 hours of assembling but will still taste good for up to 3 days.
- Store leftovers in the fridge. Allow the cake to come back to room temperature before serving for the best texture and flavour.

Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories: 183 kcal

Ingredients
- 400g malted grain brown bread flour, or wholemeal or granary bread flour
- 100g strong white bread flour
- 7g sachet easy-bake dried yeast (or 2 tsp Quick dried yeast)
- 1½ tsp salt
- 1 tbsp soft butter
- 1 large onion, cut into thin wedges
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 beaten egg
- 50g grated mature cheddar

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix the flours, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Put in the butter and rub it into the flour.

2. Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand-warm (cool rather than hot) water. With a round-bladed knife, mix in enough of the remaining water (and a bit more if needed) to gather up any dry bits and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.

3. Turn the dough onto a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until it feels smooth and elastic, adding only the minimum extra flour if necessary to prevent sticking.

4. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, cover with an upturned clean large glass bowl and leave for 45 minutes–1 hour, or until doubled in size and light and springy (timing depends on room warmth).

5. Knock the dough back by lightly kneading just 3–4 times to remove large air bubbles. Shape into a ball, cover with the bowl and leave for 15 minutes.

6. While the dough rests, fry the onion in the olive oil until very lightly caramelised, then leave to cool.

7. Cut the dough in half and shape each half into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 minutes.

8. Shape each ball by flattening into an 18cm round and place each on a large baking tray lined with baking parchment. Make 6 deepish cuts with a sharp knife to mark each round into 6 wedges. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave for 40–45 minutes, or until doubled in size.

9. Finish by brushing each round with the beaten egg, then scatter over the cooled caramelised onion and finally the grated cheddar.

10. About 20 minutes before baking, put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven and heat the oven to 230°C / 210°C fan / gas 8.

11. When ready, put the risen breads in the oven and carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the hot roasting tin to create steam. Immediately lower the temperature to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7.

12. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until golden. If the onion is getting too brown, lay a piece of parchment over the top during baking.

- 400 g icing sugar, sieved
- 4 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 bendy straw
- 2 wooden skewers
- 1 paper bag or sweet packet (see tip)
- Sticky tape

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Preheat and prepare tins
   - Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.
   - Grease and line two 20 cm cake tins with baking parchment. If your tins are shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5 cm.

2. Mix dry ingredients
   - In a bowl, combine the plain flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280 g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt.
   - If there are lumps in the sugar, break them up with your fingers.

3. Mix wet ingredients
   - In a jug measure and combine 200 ml buttermilk, 100 ml strong coffee or espresso, 150 ml vegetable oil and 2 tsp vanilla extract.
   - Add the 2 large eggs and whisk until smooth.

4. Combine and bake
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until well combined.
   - Divide the cake mixture evenly between the two prepared tins.
   - Bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
   - Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool completely.
   - (These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or wrapped well and frozen for up to two months.)

5. Make the chocolate fudge icing
   - Place 100 g milk chocolate (chopped into small pieces) in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted. (Alternatively melt gently in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds.)
   - Remove the bowl from the heat and allow the chocolate to cool slightly.
   - In a separate large bowl, mash together 200 g slightly salted butter and 400 g sieved icing sugar with a spatula to combine, then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth.
   - Sift in 4 tbsp cocoa powder, then pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix again until smooth.

6. Assemble and cover the cake
   - Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the two sponges together on a cake stand or board.
   - Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing. Don’t worry about being too neat.

7. Attach chocolate fingers
   - Immediately press the milk chocolate fingers around the sides of the iced cake so they stick to the frosting before it sets.

8. Prepare decoration chocolate
   - Melt the remaining 50 g milk chocolate in the microwave or over gently simmering water. Leave to cool until spreadable. If it firms up too much, warm briefly and stir every few minutes.

9. Build the gravity-defying sweetie column
   - Push one wooden skewer into the centre of the cake for support.
   - Slip the bendy straw over the skewer so the skewer gives the straw stability; push 1–2 cm of the straw into the cake.
   - Using the spreadable melted chocolate and a cutlery knife, spread a blob of chocolate onto a sugar-coated chocolate sweet. Starting at the base of the straw, stick the sweets to the straw.
   - Work in stages, allowing the chocolate to set a little between layers, until the straw is covered up to the bend. If the chocolate becomes too firm, reheat it briefly to return it to spreadable consistency.

10. Finish the top
    - Insert the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so it pokes out at an angle.
    - Place a paper bag or sweet packet over the top (you may need a little sticky tape to hold it in place). If any straw is exposed, cover with extra sweets.
    - Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface.

Storage:
- Will keep well stored in an airtight tin for 2 days.

Tip:
- Use the paper bag or sweet packet as the “top” of the gravity-defying column for extra effect; secure with a little sticky tape if needed.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a full 'gravity-defying' chocolate sweetie cake recipe that specifically uses milk chocolate fingers and sugar-coated tubes and is suitable for a kids' party, directly satisfying the request."

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 8 small firm pears (we used Conference)
- 200g golden caster sugar
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise
- 6 cloves
- 1 lemon, zest pared
- 1 orange, zest pared
- Vegan ice cream, to serve (optional)
- 250g pitted dates
- 2 tbsp linseeds
- 300ml unsweetened almond milk
- 200ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 175g dark muscovado sugar
- 200g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tsp ground mixed spice
- (plus 1/2 tsp salt used in the method)

Step-by-step instructions

1. Prepare the pears and poaching syrup
   - Peel the pears and trim the bottom off each so they have a flat base and will stand upright in the tin. Cut them to a height that fits snugly in your baking tin. Use a melon baller or small knife to scoop out the cores/pips from the base. Roughly chop the pear scraps (discard any cores/pips) and set the chopped scraps aside for the sponge.
   - Put the golden caster sugar, the 2 cinnamon sticks, the star anise, the 6 cloves, the lemon and orange zests, and 600ml water into a saucepan large enough to hold all the pears. Bring to the boil, then simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
   - Add the pears to the syrup, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for about 15 minutes, or until a knife easily slides into a pear. Leave the pears to cool in the poaching liquid.

2. Make the date mixture for the sponge
   - Put the 250g pitted dates and 2 tbsp linseeds into a saucepan and add the 300ml unsweetened almond milk.
   - Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2–3 minutes until the dates are soft.
   - Pour the mixture into a food processor and blitz until smooth. Add the 200ml vegetable oil and blend again until combined.
   - Scrape the date-and-oil mixture into a bowl and set aside to cool slightly.

3. Prepare the tin and dry ingredients
   - Heat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4.
   - Grease and line a 20 x 30 cm baking tin (a loose-bottomed tin is useful if you have one) with a strip of baking parchment.
   - In a large bowl put the dry ingredients: 175g dark muscovado sugar, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp ground mixed spice, and 1/2 tsp salt. Mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers and shaking the bowl to bring lumps to the surface.

4. Make the sponge and assemble
   - Add the cooled date-and-oil mixture to the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.
   - Fold in the chopped pear scraps that you reserved from coring the pears.
   - Scrape the cake mixture into the prepared tin and spread evenly.
   - Stand the poached pears upright in the batter, bottom halves embedded in the sponge so their tops remain exposed.

5. Bake
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 35–40 minutes until the cake is cooked through. Test with a skewer in the centre — it should come out clean. If there’s still wet mixture on the skewer, return the pudding to the oven for another 10 minutes and check again.

   - While the pudding bakes or after removing it from the oven, bring the reserved pear poaching liquid back to the boil and simmer until reduced to a glossy syrup.
   - When the pudding is cooked, cool it for 5–10 minutes, then brush the entire surface with the reduced pear syrup. Save a little extra syrup to serve alongside.

Difficulty: More effort

Total cooking time: 80 minutes

Calories (kcal): not specified

Ingredients
- 450g strong white bread flour, plus a little for dusting
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 1 tsp golden caster sugar
- 1½ tsp fine salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle
- 300ml warm water (measure out 300ml, you’ll use about 280ml first)
- 150g tub fresh pesto
- 240g tub semi-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
- 100g grated mozzarella (ready-grated is best as it is drier than fresh)
- 50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated
- handful basil leaves

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a tabletop mixer) combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1½ tsp fine salt.

2. Add wet ingredients and form dough: Measure out 300ml warm water. Add roughly 280ml of the water to the flour with the 2 tbsp olive oil and start mixing until the ingredients clump and form a dough. If the dough seems a little dry, add the remaining water. 

3. Knead: Once combined, knead the dough for 10 minutes by hand on your work surface or for 5 minutes on medium speed in a mixer. The dough is ready when it feels soft, springy and elastic.

4. First rise: Clean the bowl, drizzle in a little oil, then return the dough to the bowl, turning it so the sides are coated in oil. Cover with oiled cling film and set aside in a warm place to double in size — this will take about 1–3 hours depending on temperature.

5. Prepare for shaping: Line a baking tray with parchment paper. When the dough has doubled, uncover and punch it down a couple of times to knock out the air. Tip the dough onto a floured work surface and dust the top with a little flour if sticky.

6. Roll out and fill: Roll the dough to a rectangle roughly 40 x 30cm. Spread the fresh pesto evenly over the dough, then scatter over the chopped semi-dried tomatoes, both cheeses (mozzarella and parmesan) and the basil leaves.

7. Roll and cut: Roll the dough up from one of the longer sides into a long sausage. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 12 even pieces.

8. Arrange to prove: Place the 12 pieces on the prepared baking tray, cut-side up, in a 3-by-4 formation. Make sure the open end of each roll is tucked in toward the centre of each spiral so they don’t uncoil while baking. Leave a little space between each roll — they’ll grow and touch as they prove. Loosely cover with oiled cling film and leave to prove for 30 mins–1 hr until almost doubled in size again. Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / gas 6 while they’re proving.

9. Bake: Uncover when puffed up. Bake on the middle shelf for 35–40 minutes until golden brown and the centre looks dry and not doughy.

10. Cool and serve: Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.

Notes
- Ready-grated mozzarella is recommended because it contains less moisture than fresh which helps prevent the whirls becoming soggy.
- Rising times vary with room temperature; allow the dough to double fully at both rises for best texture.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a complete pesto and cheese whirls recipe using fresh pesto, basil and semi-dried tomatoes, includes a stated difficulty level and time estimates with step-by-step instructions, directly addressing the question."

f6ddaab0-0064-49ed-964a-9f365b134a9b,"How can I make a light-textured, lower-gluten rye loaf with honey and optional caraway seeds?","Rye bread
Difficulty: Easy
Total cooking time: 50 minutes
Calories: 170 kcal

Ingredients
- 200 g rye flour, plus extra for dusting
- 200 g strong white or wholemeal flour
- 7 g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- ½ tsp fine salt
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp caraway seed (optional)
- 250 ml warm water (more if needed)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Mix dry ingredients: Tip the rye and white/wholemeal flours, the yeast and the salt into a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.

2. Mix liquid: In a jug, mix the honey into about 250 ml warm water.

3. Make the dough: Pour the honeyed water into the bowl with the flours and mix to form a dough. Rye flour absorbs a lot of water and can feel dry — if the dough looks too dry, add a little more warm water until you have a soft dough.

4. Knead: Tip the dough out onto your work surface and knead for about 10 minutes until reasonably smooth. (Rye contains less gluten than white flour, so the dough will not feel as springy as a conventional white loaf.)

5. First rise: Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for 1–2 hours, or until roughly doubled in size.

6. Prepare tin: Dust a 2 lb / 900 g loaf tin with flour.

7. Shape and add caraway (optional): Tip the dough back onto the work surface and knead briefly to knock out any large air bubbles. If using caraway seeds, work them into the dough now. Shape into a smooth oval loaf and place it into the prepared tin.

8. Second rise: Cover the tin with oiled cling film and leave to rise somewhere warm for a further 1–1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

9. Preheat oven: Heat the oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / gas 7.

10. Finish and bake: Remove the cling film and dust the surface of the loaf with rye flour. Slash a few incisions on an angle across the top. Bake for about 30 minutes until the crust is dark brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

11. Cool: Transfer the loaf to a wire cooling rack and leave to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving.

Notes
- Because rye has less gluten, the crumb will be denser than a pure white loaf but this recipe uses half strong white flour to give a lighter texture while keeping rye flavor.
- Adjust water as needed — rye flour often needs more hydration than wheat flour.",RELEVANT,"The answer directly provides a recipe and step-by-step method for a light-textured, lower-gluten rye loaf that includes honey and optional caraway seeds, and explains ingredient ratios and hydration to achieve the desired texture."

Difficulty: Easy

Total cooking time: 80 minutes

Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients:
- 375g salted butter, softened, plus extra for the tin
- 375g golden caster sugar
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 375g self-raising flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- 150ml milk
- Blue food colouring
- Pink food colouring
- Sprinkles, to decorate

For the buttercream:
- 250g salted butter, softened
- 400g icing sugar, sifted
- Seeds from 1 vanilla pod (or 1 tsp vanilla extract if preferred)
- 100g full-fat cream cheese

Steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / gas 4. Butter and line three 20cm loose-bottomed sandwich cake tins with baking parchment.

2. Make the sponge batter: Beat 375g softened salted butter and 375g golden caster sugar together in a stand mixer or using an electric whisk for 5–8 minutes, until light and fluffy.

3. Add the eggs: Whisk in the 6 eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

4. Fold in dry ingredients and milk: Gently fold in 375g self-raising flour and 1½ tsp baking powder, then add 150ml milk to loosen the batter to a soft dropping consistency.

5. Divide and colour the batter: Divide the mixture between three bowls (weigh if you want them equal). Colour one bowl blue and another pink — start with a little colouring and add more until you reach the desired shade. Leave the third bowl uncoloured (plain).

6. Create the zebra effect in the tins: Have the three tins and three bowls of batter ready. Working quickly, spoon a heaped tablespoon of blue batter into the centre of the first tin, a heaped tablespoon of pink batter into the centre of the second tin, and a heaped tablespoon of plain batter into the centre of the third tin. Immediately add another dollop of a different coloured batter on top of each one, alternating colours — do not wait for batter to spread. The weight of each dollop will push previous batter outward and create concentric rings. Continue alternating colours (adding roughly equal dollops) until all batter is used. Very gently tap and shake the tins to even the tops.

7. Bake: Bake the cakes in the centre of the oven for 25–30 minutes, or until firm to the touch and a skewer comes out clean.

8. Cool: Turn the cakes out top-side down onto wire racks straightaway, then leave to cool completely.

9. Make the buttercream: Put 250g softened salted butter, 400g sifted icing sugar and the vanilla seeds into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or use a bowl and electric whisk). Beat for about 5 minutes until fluffy and aerated. Add 100g full-fat cream cheese and beat briefly until just combined (do not overbeat).

10. Assemble the cake: Place one cooled sponge on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the buttercream over it. Repeat with the second sponge, then the third.

11. Finish icing: Spread a smooth layer of buttercream over the top and sides of the stacked cake using a large palette knife. For a slightly rustic “naked” look, leave a few slightly less-iced spots if you like.

12. Decorate: Top the cake with sprinkles and candles as desired.

Storage: Keeps in an airtight tin for up to three days.",RELEVANT,"The answer provides a complete easy rainbow zebra cake recipe matching the request: blue and pink food colouring, buttercream, sprinkles, and a total time of about 80 minutes, with clear ingredients and step-by-step instructions."

Vegan Simnel Cake

Difficulty level
More effort

Total cooking time
180 minutes

Calories (kcal)
Not provided

Ingredients
- 200 ml soya milk
- 1 lemon, zested and ½ juiced
- 500 g marzipan
- Icing sugar, for dusting
- 250 g dairy-free spread, plus extra for the tin
- 250 g mixed dried fruit (suggested: sultanas, raisins and candied peel)
- 75 g glacé cherries, roughly chopped
- 1 orange, zested and juiced
- 200 g light brown soft sugar
- 200 g plain flour
- 75 g ground almonds
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp ground ginger
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 25 g apricot jam, warmed, plus extra for sticking the marzipan balls to the cake
- Pinch of salt

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prep the milk and lemon: Mix the soya milk with the ½ juiced lemon in a jug and set aside for a few minutes to thicken.

2. Prepare the marzipan disc: Cut 150 g of the marzipan from the larger block. Lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll this 150 g piece out until it's just slightly smaller than the base of a 23 cm cake tin. Set aside.

3. Prepare the tin and oven: Using the dairy-free spread, butter a 23 cm springform cake tin and line it with a double layer of baking parchment. Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.

4. Mix the fruit: In a large bowl, combine the mixed dried fruit, lemon zest, the roughly chopped glacé cherries, and the orange zest and juice. Toss until well combined.

5. Make the batter: Beat the dairy-free spread with the light brown sugar until pale using an electric whisk. Add the plain flour, ground almonds, baking powder, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, mixed spice and vanilla bean paste, and mix. Tip in the milk-and-lemon mixture and mix to a smooth batter. Fold in the fruit mixture and a pinch of salt, including any juice from the fruit bowl. The batter may look slightly curdled — that’s fine.

6. Assemble for baking: Spoon half the batter into the prepared tin and gently smooth the surface. Lay the prepared marzipan round on top of this layer of batter. Spoon over the remaining batter and smooth the top.

7. Bake — first stage: Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes at 180°C (160°C fan) / gas 4.

8. Bake — second stage: After 30 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 150°C (130°C fan) / gas 2 and continue baking for another 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean and the cake is well-risen and firm.

9. Cool: Carefully remove the cake from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.

10. Glaze and top with marzipan: Brush the warm apricot jam over the cooled cake. Cut a 200 g piece from the remaining marzipan and roll it out (dusting with icing sugar) until you can cut a 23 cm circle using the base of the cake tin as a guide. Use a rolling pin to lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface — the apricot jam will help it stick.

11. Make the marzipan balls: Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little warmed apricot jam to stick the marzipan balls around the edge of the cake (these represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas).

12. Finish (optional): If you like, use a kitchen blowtorch carefully to lightly burnish the marzipan balls and the marzipan topping until just golden — take care not to burn them.

   - Butter three 20cm round cake tins and line their bases with baking parchment.
   - Heat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5.

2. Make the sponge batter
   - In a large bowl, beat together 340g softened unsalted butter and 340g caster sugar until light and smooth.

   - Leave to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

4. Make the Swiss meringue buttercream
   - Put the 5 egg whites and 375g caster sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a small pan of gently simmering water, ensuring the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk for 3–4 minutes until the sugar dissolves.

7. Colour the remaining buttercream
   - Divide the reserved buttercream between 11 small bowls.
   - Mix a different gel colouring into 10 of the bowls, leaving the eleventh bowl white.
   - Fit a separate piping bag for each colour (either cut a ~1 cm hole in the end of the bag or fit a round nozzle).

8. Decorate with rainbow swirls
   - Pipe one row of buttercream blobs in alternating colours from the top edge to the bottom edge of the cake.

   - For the second row, choose the colour that is next in sequence to the colour alongside it, piping over the thinnest part of that smeared blob.
   - Continue piping around the cake following this pattern to create a swirl effect of colours.
   - Repeat the same piping-and-smearing method in a circle on the top of the cake, this time smearing the icing in towards the middle until the top is covered.

9. Serve and store
   - The cake is ready to slice and serve.

- 200 g raspberries
- 410 g can peach slices in fruit juice, drained and chopped
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 tbsp honey
- 2 x 320 g shortcrust pastry sheets
- 1 egg, beaten
- 150 g icing sugar
- Freeze-dried raspberries or sprinkles, optional

Step-by-step instructions
1. Set 6 plump raspberries aside. Tip the remaining raspberries into a bowl and add the drained, chopped peaches. Toss together.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 75 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 8 small firm pears (Conference)
- 200g golden caster sugar
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise
- 6 cloves
- Zest of 1 lemon, pared
- Zest of 1 orange, pared
- Vegan ice cream, to serve (optional)
- 250g pitted dates
- 2 tbsp linseeds
- 300ml unsweetened almond milk
- 200ml vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing
- 175g dark muscovado sugar
- 200g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1 tsp ground mixed spice

Step-by-step instructions
1. Prepare the pears:
   - Peel the pears. Cut the bottom off each pear so they have a flat base and are a height to fit snugly in your tin.
   - Use a melon baller or small knife to scoop out the pips from the base of each pear. Roughly chop the pear scraps (discard the pips) and set the chopped scraps aside.

2. Poach the pears:
   - Tip 200g golden caster sugar, the 2 cinnamon sticks, star anise, 6 cloves, lemon and orange zests, and 600ml water into a saucepan large enough to hold all the pears.
   - Bring to the boil, then simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
   - Add the pears, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for about 15 minutes, until a knife easily slides into a pear.
   - Leave the pears to cool in the poaching liquid.

3. Make the date purée for the sponge:
   - Put the 250g pitted dates and 2 tbsp linseeds in a saucepan and add the 300ml almond milk.
   - Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2–3 minutes until the dates are soft.
   - Pour the mixture into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
   - Add the 200ml vegetable oil and blend again until combined. Scrape into a bowl and set aside to cool slightly.

4. Prepare and preheat:
   - Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) / Gas 4.
   - Grease and line a 20 x 30 cm baking tin (a loose-bottomed one if possible) with a strip of baking parchment.

5. Make the sponge batter:
   - Put the dry ingredients (175g dark muscovado sugar, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp ground mixed spice) in a large mixing bowl.
   - Add 1/2 tsp salt (see note in step) and mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers and giving the bowl a few shakes to bring any remaining lumps to the surface.
   - Add the date and oil mixture and stir well to combine.
   - Fold in the chopped pear scraps set aside from step 1.

6. Assemble and bake:
   - Scrape the cake mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface.
   - Nestle the poached pears into the sponge mixture, standing them upright so their bottom halves are covered by the batter.
   - Bake for 35–40 minutes until the cake is cooked through. Insert a skewer into the centre — it should come out clean. If there is wet cake mixture on the skewer, return the cake to the oven for another 10 minutes, then check again.

7. Make the sticky toffee syrup and finish:
   - Meanwhile, bring the reserved pear poaching liquid back to the boil and simmer until it has reduced to a glossy syrup.
   - When the pudding is cooked, cool for 5–10 minutes, then brush all over with the reduced syrup, reserving a little extra syrup to serve alongside.

8. Serve:
   - Serve warm slices of the pudding, with the extra syrup spooned over and vegan ice cream, if using.

Difficulty: More effort
Total cooking time: 90 minutes
Calories (kcal): Not provided

Ingredients
- 400g strawberries, hulled then halved or quartered (save a few whole with stalks on, to serve)
- 400g cherries, halved and pitted (save a few whole with stalks on, to serve)
- 50g icing sugar, plus 1 tbsp
- 600ml pot double cream
- 50ml amaretto
- ½ tsp almond extract
- 6 large egg whites
- 300g white caster sugar
- ¾ tsp white wine vinegar
- 100g flaked toasted almonds (plus a few extra to scatter on top)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 140°C (120°C fan)/gas 1. Cut 3 pieces of baking parchment to fit 3 baking sheets for the meringues. If you don’t have 3 baking sheets, you can cook in batches — divide the meringue mixture into 3 and cook separately.

2. Using a plate or the base of a cake tin, draw a 20cm circle on each piece of parchment, then flip the parchment over so the pencil mark is on the underside (pencil side facing down). Put 3 oven racks in your oven — if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this will work too, sat in the bottom of the oven.

3. Put the egg whites in a large bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk until thick and holding soft peaks.

4. Start adding the white caster sugar, 1–2 tbsp at a time, whisking continuously. When all the sugar has been incorporated the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks.

5. Add the white wine vinegar and whisk again briefly.

6. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles.

7. Scatter the flaked toasted almonds over the meringues, saving a few to serve on top once assembled.

8. Bake the meringues for 1 hour, then leave them to cool in the oven. When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hours, or assemble straight away.

9. Meanwhile, toss the strawberries and cherries with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10–15 minutes.

10. Pour the double cream, amaretto, almond extract and the remaining 50g icing sugar into a large bowl and whisk until softly whipped.

11. To assemble: use a little of the cream to stick your least-successful (flattest) meringue to a cake stand or serving plate. Spread over a third of the whipped cream and scatter with some of the macerated strawberries and cherries.

12. Top with the next meringue layer, spread another third of the cream and scatter more fruit. Finish with the final meringue, spread the remaining cream and decorate the top layer with the reserved whole strawberries and cherries.

13. Scatter over the remaining toasted flaked almonds and any saved almond pieces, then serve.

Ingredients
- 215ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin
- 300ml soy milk, almond or coconut milk
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 335g light muscovado sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
- 175g soy yogurt or coconut yogurt
- 300g self-raising flour
- 105g cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 100g dark dairy-free chocolate
- 140g vegan spread, at room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract
- 265g icing sugar, sifted
- ½–1 tbsp plant milk (use the same plant milk as in the sponge)
- Colourful sprinkles (make sure they're suitable for vegans), to decorate (optional)

Step-by-step instructions
1. Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)/gas mark 4. Oil a 23 x 33 cm baking tin (at least 4 cm deep) and line the base and sides with baking parchment.

2. Whisk the plant milk and apple cider vinegar together in a jug – the milk should curdle slightly. Set aside.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the muscovado sugar, sunflower oil and the 1 tsp vanilla extract. Then whisk in the soy or coconut yogurt, breaking down any sugar lumps as you go. Pour in the soured milk mixture and mix well.

4. Sift the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into a separate bowl and stir to combine.

5. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until you have a smooth batter. Be careful not to over-mix.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 30–35 minutes, until well risen and springy. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out almost clean — a few sticky crumbs are fine, but the mixture should not be wet.

9. Beat the vegan spread and 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract on high speed (stand mixer or electric hand whisk) for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the sifted icing sugar gradually, starting on a low speed then increasing to high until the mixture is light and creamy.

10. Pour in the cooled melted chocolate and combine thoroughly. If the icing is very stiff, add ½–1 tbsp plant milk (the same milk used in the sponge) to loosen it. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 minutes before using.

11. When the cake is completely cool, spread the buttercream evenly over the top. Decorate with vegan sprinkles if you like.

Ingredients:
- 500g fresh spinach
- 3 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 6 spring onions, ends trimmed, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- Generous pinch of ground nutmeg
- 200g ricotta
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tbsp chopped dill, plus 1 rounded tsp
- 2 tbsp snipped chives
- 2 tsp chopped mint
- 5 sheets filo pastry (each about 46 x 25cm and about 250g total weight)
- 100g feta
- Minted yogurt dip (optional, to serve)
- Tomato, cucumber & pepper salad (optional, to serve)

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Pack the spinach into a large heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over and press the spinach down with a wooden spoon. Leave for 1 minute to wilt, stirring a couple of times so all the leaves are submerged.

2. Tip the wilted spinach into a large colander and place under running cold water to cool quickly. Drain well – squeeze out any excess water by pressing the spinach down with the wooden spoon, then squeezing with your hands. Using kitchen paper, pat the spinach dry into a compact shape, lay it on a board and roughly chop, then set aside.

3. Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the shallot, spring onions and garlic, and fry over a high-ish heat for 3–4 minutes, stirring often, until softened and just starting to brown.

4. Lower the heat, tip in the chopped spinach and stir for 1 minute only to finish drying. Season with pepper and a good pinch of nutmeg, and leave to cool.

7. Lightly oil a 20cm square x 4cm deep cake tin. Mix the remaining oil with the 1 rounded tsp dill.

8. Lay the filo pastry sheets on a large board. Brush the top one with a little of the dill oil, then carefully lower it into the tin to line the base and two of the sides, with an overhang on both sides. The pastry doesn’t have to fit in smoothly – a few wrinkles and folds are fine.

9. Brush a bit more oil over the second pastry sheet and this time lay it down in the tin the other way round, so it drapes over and lines the base and the other two sides. The tin should now be completely covered, with a pastry overhang all round.

10. Repeat the criss-cross layering with two more oiled filo sheets.
